                  <p>A jury of one’s peers is a prominent way to adjudicate disputes and is increasingly used in participatory governance online. The fairness of this approach rests on the assumption that juries are consistent: that the same jury would hand down similar judgments to similar cases. However, prior literature suggests that social influence would instead cause early interactions to cascade into different judgments for similar cases. In this paper, we report an online experiment that changes participants’ pseudonyms as they appear to collaborators, temporarily masking a jury’s awareness that they have deliberated together before. This technique allows us to measure consistency by reconvening the same jury on similar cases. Counter to expectation, juries are equally consistent as individuals, a result that is “good for democracy.” But this consistency arises in part due to group polarization, as consensus develops by hardening initial majority opinions. Furthermore, we find that aggregating groups’ perspectives without deliberation erodes consistency.</p>

                <h2>Disarming Loaded Words: Addressing Gender Bias in Political Reporting | C+J 2020</h2>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read More</button>
                <div class="content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                    Gender bias has been a pervasive issue in U.S. political coverage since women gained the franchise in 1920. Women are routinely targeted for their appearance, likeability, and familial qualities—characteristics for which men are rarely scrutinized. As a way to help journalists and editors identify and correct gender-biased language in political reporting, we introduce “Disarming Loaded Words” (DLW) as a new solution to this issue. DLW is a computational tool, backed by both machine learning and human expert curation, that tags potentially biased words in a document and provides feedback and context for why a word may be problematic. DLW provides a minimally disruptive way to nudge journalists toward understanding unconscious biases. It was successfully prototyped as a standalone Google Docs add-on, and the code for its model, interface, and API are now open-source and available for use on other platforms.</p>

                <h2>ModBotHero6: A Human-Centered Content Moderation Slackbot</h2>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read More</button>
                <div class="content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                    As a platform, Slack has almost no built-in content moderation. On the vanilla Slack platform, it's possible to curse out your teammates, post hateful content, and disseminate misinformation with impunity.</p>
                    <p>
                    Thus, enter ModBotHero6. We combine a little bit of Reddit moderation bot with a little bit of Baymax—the friendly robot from Big Hero 6 that always asks its users whether they're 'satisfied with their care.' Like Baymax, our goal here is to put humans first. Our philosophy was to use the AI-powered moderation bot to remove or reduce immediate potential threats (i.e., hate speech, sexually explicit material, etc.) while also clearly signalling our understanding that AI isn't perfect. Some uses of profanity are positive, or appropriate given context—nuances that AI cannot yet detect. As such, the content we moderate goes to a human moderator for final approval. Each moderation report contains the API scores, in addition to a link to the message for context and bot-generated suggested actions.</p>
                    <p>
                    We also realize that AI isn't perfect at catching every instance of abuse. Some types of abuse are nuanced, and hate speech is almost always culturally-specific. As a result, this bot also includes a flow for users to report abusive content, which, in turn, also gets directed to the moderator channel.</p>

                <h2>Zeal: Motivating Online Petitioning by Browsing the News</h2>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Read More</button>
                <div class="content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Online petitions are a powerful but at times deeply flawed digital space. Despite the increasing importance of online petitions in galvanizing support for key issues, over 99% of petitions fail to achieve their goal, and the top 5% of users on Change.org (a popular online petitioning website) write 50% of the signatures. As a result, engagement in online petitions is incredibly uneven, and there are far more passive observers than active petitioners.</p>

                    <p>We introduce Zeal, a mobile application that encourages the otherwise passive consumer of content to take social action in the online petition space. Zeal combines news, a commonly consumed type of mobile content, with petitions related to the news articles. Drawing from the Fogg Behavior Model, we hypothesized that users who were invested in the news (motivated), faced with a simple ask (signing a petition), and given a prompt (Zeal’s news/petitions interface) would increase their petition-signing behavior. We then conducted a 10-day field study, through which we validated Zeal as a proof-of-concept for encouraging social action, but found that news alone is insufficient to fully motivate petition-signing behavior.</p>

                        I had the immense fortune of studying abroad at Oxford from April - June 2019, where I worked on five papers under an advisor at the Oxford Internet Institute. There, I spent some of the happiest and most intellectually free months of my life so far, deep-diving into the socio-political implications of an increasingly digitized world.
