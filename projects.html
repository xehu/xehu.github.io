                <h2>Are Juries More Consistent? Comparing Individual and Group Decision-Making via Online Deliberation</h2>
                <p>
                Democratic governance, both online and offline, relies on the effectiveness of jury decision-making. However, the legitimacy of jury decisions requires that juries' outcomes are not random: that outcomes depend more on the case as presented, rather than on arbitrary, path-dependent features of the deliberation. In this project, we test this assumption by utilizing a pseudonymous online deliberation platform to reconvene the exact same jury without the group's knowledge that they are working with the same people again, and measure the consistency of the jury's judgments. Ultimately, we find that groups and individuals are equally consistent; participating in a group also does not affect an individual’s own decision consistency. We also find that minority voices are more influential in deliberation than previously expected. These results are especially interesting in light of the fact that participants greatly underestimated the consistency of the teams they participated in. Jury decisions are consistent despite a widespread perception to the contrary.

                <h2>Disarming Loaded Words: Addressing Gender Bias in Political Reporting</h2>
                <p>
                Gender bias has been a pervasive issue in U.S. political coverage since women gained the franchise in 1920. Women are routinely targeted for their appearance, likeability, and familial qualities—characteristics for which men are rarely scrutinized. As a way to help journalists and editors identify and correct gender-biased language in political reporting, we introduce “Disarming Loaded Words” (DLW) as a new solution to this issue. DLW is a computational tool, backed by both machine learning and human expert curation, that tags potentially biased words in a document and provides feedback and context for why a word may be problematic. DLW provides a minimally disruptive way to nudge journalists toward understanding unconscious biases. It was successfully prototyped as a standalone Google Docs add-on, and the code for its model, interface, and API are now open-source and available for use on other platforms.</p>

                <h2>ModBotHero6: A Human-Centered Content Moderation Slackbot</h2>
                <p>
                As a platform, Slack has almost no built-in content moderation. On the vanilla Slack platform, it's possible to curse out your teammates, post hateful content, and disseminate misinformation with impunity.</p>
                <p>
                Thus, enter ModBotHero6. We combine a little bit of Reddit moderation bot with a little bit of Baymax—the friendly robot from Big Hero 6 that always asks its users whether they're 'satisfied with their care.' Like Baymax, our goal here is to put humans first. Our philosophy was to use the AI-powered moderation bot to remove or reduce immediate potential threats (i.e., hate speech, sexually explicit material, etc.) while also clearly signalling our understanding that AI isn't perfect. Some uses of profanity are positive, or appropriate given context—nuances that AI cannot yet detect. As such, the content we moderate goes to a human moderator for final approval. Each moderation report contains the API scores, in addition to a link to the message for context and bot-generated suggested actions.</p>
                <p>
                We also realize that AI isn't perfect at catching every instance of abuse. Some types of abuse are nuanced, and hate speech is almost always culturally-specific. As a result, this bot also includes a flow for users to report abusive content, which, in turn, also gets directed to the moderator channel.</p>

                <p>
                Shopping is meant to be social—a way to bring families together. Instead, some family members (predominantly women) shop, while others sit at the sidelines. Battleshop is a collaborative shopping game that enables shoppers to complete shopping goals together through a gameified experience—ultimately, bringing families and friends together.

                    I had the immense fortune of studying abroad at Oxford from April - June 2019, where I worked on five papers under an advisor at the Oxford Internet Institute. There, I spent some of the happiest and most intellectually free months of my life so far, deep-diving into the socio-political implications of an increasingly digitized world.

                Product design is a powerful tool that can subconsciously shape users' lives and everyday decisions. Used maliciously, users can suffer physical or mental harm. How might we create a framework that introduces ethics into product design, specifically with regard to products that rely on user information?
