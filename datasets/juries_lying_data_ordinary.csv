niceRhino: Hello! ,False
culturedCow: Hi!,False
spryBison: Hello,False
youngLion: Hi,False
smallGiraffe: hi,False
culturedBear: hello,False
smallGiraffe: I don't think the guy is the a$$hole. Thoughts?,False
spryBison: So who thinks the guy is an ass for asking his mother in law to learn english,False
"niceRhino: I think that this person is not an asshole because, according to him, he was very polite while approaching the issue",False
youngLion: I can see how the family is upset because they feel the mother was disrespected but I can also understand the guy's feelings. Why should he have to work as interpreter for his mother in law?,False
"niceRhino: Yes, I think his feeling makes sense to me to. Who doesn't want to be independent.",False
culturedCow: I was conflicted because I could understand his frustration however I feel he should have maybe discussed strategies with how to approach the mother in law with his wife first.,False
smallGiraffe: His MIL has been here for 8 years. You would think she'd pick up some English by now.,False
spryBison: I think he had every right to want to help his mother in law,False
niceRhino: I also agree with culturedCow,False
"youngLion: I don't think he's an asshole. I think his request is reasonable. If you go to live in a foreign country, you should learn the language.",False
"spryOrangutan: I think the guy is an asshole because for all his talk about how easy it is to use resources to learn a language, he didn't take the time to research WHY some people do not.",False
niceRhino: I think he also tried to utilize other resources such as language learning apps to help her learn,False
"culturedCow: I think also he needs to understand that language learning is not the same for everyone, not everyone has the same capacity to learn new languages quickly.",False
"youngLion: Maybe she does have a problem with learning languages, but she could at least try.",False
spryBison: After the edit he done it made it sound like he really loves his family,False
"culturedBear: I don't think the guy is wrong in asking her to learn more english being that she lives in America, but he has to understand she is older and may not have the patience or capacity to learn a lot of english.",False
"spryOrangutan: Learning a second language is easiest when you're a child for a reason. Your brain is wired differently then, which makes it easier.",False
smallGiraffe: I think he tried to help her.  He gave her resources to use and she apparently didn't use them.,False
spryOrangutan: Older people can have a hard time because of brain. intelligence and cognitive limits. It's not so easy to just read a book or dictionary after a certain point.,False
"culturedCow: I don't think he's an asshole for having the feelings he does, but I do think he is a bit of an asshole for handling it the way that he did without discussing it with his wife first or maybe finding a better way to approach it.",False
youngLion: I think he wouldn't be so upset about it if she at least tried.,False
culturedBear: He should also ask his wife to step up and talk to the mother to healp her learn more and to make herself more available to her mother to help with translations.,False
smallGiraffe: I agree that learning a foreign language as an adult is more difficult but 8 years is a long time.,False
niceRhino: I think that both sides have right and wrong. But overall i think he's not an asshole because of the way he approached the issue (politely) and because he also tried in his own way (although some of us may say not effective) to help her,False
"youngLion: Yes, why can't other members of the family help their mother? If they think he's being a jerk, they should step in.  I",False
niceRhino: What are your verdicts?,False
"spryOrangutan: If he doesn't want to help, that's fine, but dictating what his MIL, who I assume is not so young, should do is complete asshole-ry.",False
spryBison: I think he is a nice person trying to relieve some stress off his plate by asking his mother in law to be more responsible.,False
"spryOrangutan: Yes, asshole, all the way.",False
youngLion: Not an asshole,False
culturedBear: MIL is at least 20 years older than the couple so 8 years is a long time but how often is she interacting with other Americans.,False
spryBison: We all have to agree,False
"culturedCow: Yeah I am also inclined to vote 'asshole' just because something seems fishy that the entire family freaked out on him, so I don't know if he was as polite as he claimed he was.",False
smallGiraffe: I think his family is partally dorrect for being upset because of his approach.,False
spryOrangutan: I descent. Asshole still for me.,False
spryBison: Asswhole it is,False
culturedBear: The guy is not wrong and definitely not a racist.,False
littleSquirrel: I think he should consider the fact that for some reason some people always tend to be dependent especially coming from a specific culture and upbringing - especially women and elderly.,False
"spryOrangutan: No, he's not a racist, agrred.",False
spryBison: we can call him a nice asswhole,False
youngLion: I will go with the group and vote asshole.,False
"culturedBear: The guy just wants MIL to put in more effort, if possible.",False
niceRhino: I believe that this person is not an asshole because he tried to help the MIL.,False
spryBison: Asshole,False
smallGiraffe: I agree with niceRhino,False
smallGiraffe: I don't think he's the asshole,False
newLion: hi,False
likelyRabbit: I don't think she's the asshole because she's extremely busy.,False
conventionalMonkey: howdy,False
newLion: This girl seems like an asshole,False
littleCow: Hello,False
likelyRabbit: Her husband knows Spanish and communicates well with it.,False
"littleCow: I don't think she's an asshole, she clearly has more on her plate so it shouldn't be an issue for her husband to help relieve some of that burden.",False
"likelyRabbit: If she weren't so busy, I'd say she was an asshole but she's got a very full plate",False
newLion: He married the daughter not the mother,False
newPanda: I'm on the fence about this one. She may be busy but how often is her mother really bothering her husband? How long have they lived in the US? Information is missing as far as I'm concerned.,False
conventionalMonkey: I think she's an asshole. Her husband has the right to not want to be a translator. It's his choice and he shouldn't be forced.,False
"likelyRabbit: Yes, he married the daughter but his MIL is now family too.",False
newLion: true conventionalMonkey conventionalMonkey,False
"likelyGorilla: She says ""she just passes it on to her husband"", if her husband sees that she doesn't try to put in any efforts to help her parents with such issues, then why would he care either?",False
"conventionalMonkey: But then again, I think many Latino families are more egalitarian in that they expect everyone to contribute more.",False
"newPanda: I agree conventionalMonkey While they are his in-laws, they are her family. ",False
newLion: I think the mother needs to find an alternative,False
conventionalMonkey: Her stance is probably more of a culture perspective than an asshole-y one.,False
likelyRabbit: I haven't personally gone for my Masters but I have gone to college.  That's a ton of work she's doing.,False
newLion: The have google translator on phones,False
newPanda: We are only hearing her side of it too. I agree newLion  the MIL could find other people to translate.,False
"littleCow: I feel there is also some cultural things that need to be taken into account. There maybe a difference between hers and her husband's, but I don't think that makes her an asshole.",False
newLion: I say nice asshole,False
conventionalMonkey: I think she should ask her husband when and if he's available to translate beforehand.,False
"likelyGorilla: She should expect to do more herself than expecting her husband to help every time. Once in a while, if the husband can be of help, then it's great. But can't be expected to help all the time, when she ""just passes on""",False
likelyRabbit: newLion Great point.  Maybe they can educate her mom.,False
conventionalMonkey: Just having mom call out of the blue is unacceptable to me.,False
newLion: But the mother quit going through the daughter and started calling him directly.,False
"conventionalMonkey: I have considered both sides. While I don't dislike this person, I think her expectations of her husband are somewhat asshole-y.",False
newLion: I say asshole,False
conventionalMonkey: I think the daughter made the mother think it was okay to just call directly.,False
likelyRabbit: I still say not an asshole.  She's very busy.,False
"conventionalMonkey: She's so busy, she wanted to stop being the middleman.",False
newPanda: I understand wanting to help her parents but I think there is also an issue with this woman using her husband. She is an asshole.,False
"likelyGorilla: Every relationship has limitation in terms of expectation. If the husband willingly helps, that's great. If not, she should nicely try to approach him for helping out",False
conventionalMonkey: Asshole with reservations from me.,False
newLion: Maybe she needs to take some off her plate,False
"littleCow: Yeah, I'm not convinced she's an asshole. I do think the situation could be settled in a way that's more ideal to both parties, but she's working full time and going through her Master's which is a lot.",False
conventionalMonkey: If only there was choice beside yay or nay.,False
likelyRabbit: I agree littleCow,False
newLion: I say asshole under stress,False
"conventionalMonkey: Yes, she is the asshole... unfortunately. Husband has stuff to do too and is entitled to not want to translate at her mother's whim.",False
newPanda: I think she is being presumptuous and acting like her husband's feelings don't matter. ,False
"newLion: Tha's true, she ins't considering her husband and his feelings",False
likelyRabbit: I don't agree.  Not the asshole.  She's too busy.,False
"culturedPanda: That person is definitely an asshole, I honestly don't care that the person can",False
newHippo: This guy doesn't seem to understand the delicacy of this issue.,False
"culturedPanda: learn a bunch of languages, expecting an elderly to do the same is unfair.",False
"littleSquirrel: I think they're an asshole because of how they approached it. They could have said - hey, I'm a little overwhelmed by all this, which is valid",False
conventionalMonkey: I don't think he was being an asshole. He was actually very polite. He loves his Latino family. He wants to teach them English.,False
"newHippo: Yes, he's definitely not being sensitive.",False
culturedPanda: con,False
"youngPig: Yes, he is the asshole. Just because he had no trouble learning new languages doesn't mean everyone can. The older people get, the harder learning language is.",False
culturedPanda: Exactly youngPig,False
culturedPanda: conventionalMonkey,False
culturedPanda: What if they don't want to learn?,False
spryGorilla: It sounds like he reached his boiling point and she called at a bad time so he reached his breaking point,False
newHippo: It seems like if we're all going toa gree it'd be easier to make the case for him being an asshole.,False
"newHippo: LOgistically it makes mroe sense anyways, although he was kind of douchey.",False
conventionalDonkey: ControversialMonkey i agree with you,False
"littleSquirrel: I don't think that's fair, newHippo People have the right to share opinions, even if differing",False
culturedPanda: ^,False
culturedPanda: I agree with sq,False
"newHippo: Okay, but we all ahve to agree, and I wouldnt give him a pass for his lack of foresight.",False
culturedPanda: It's realistically not reasonable to ask for someone to learn a new language,False
conventionalMonkey: I still think he was being polite,False
"culturedPanda: The elders raised her daughter fine without english, and all of a sudden the dude that she marries is making them learn?",False
youngPig: He seems arrogant because he thinks it's as easy for everyone else to learn a language as it was for him.,False
spryGorilla: On one side he did learn portuges and rusian in two years.,False
littleSquirrel: You can be polite and still be wrong,False
culturedPanda: I agree youngPig,False
conventionalMonkey: He wasn't trying to offend them,False
spryGorilla: The lady has been in this country for 8 years and still cant speak english.,False
conventionalDonkey: 🐵 👍,False
conventionalMonkey: 8 years is a long time,False
culturedPanda: spryGorilla What is your point? ,False
spryGorilla: I dont think he is a asshole in real life but just had a bad day.,False
"youngPig: If he doesn't want to help her translate, that's fine. But emphasizing 'learn the language' is what makes him the asshole.",False
"newHippo: I dont judge at all, but I'mma vote him the asshole. ",False
"culturedPanda: They live in an area full of hispanics, she realistically did not need to learn english for 8 yyears",False
"littleSquirrel: How many languages can you speak, spryGorilla",False
culturedPanda: Asshole,False
spryGorilla: yes a asshole,False
littleSquirrel: Asshole,False
"conventionalDonkey: Personal experience, My ex girlfriend went through school and still doesnt know english. ",False
culturedPanda: Yeah how many can you speak,False
conventionalMonkey: I don't think he was an asshole,False
spryGorilla: yes this person acted as an asshole this day.,False
"culturedPanda: agreed, asshole",False
"newCow: There are some people who believe if you marry a person that you marry their family, but that only works if you have a family.",False
littleHorse: I think she is an asshole. He should not be expected to have to translate everything for his family in law.,False
"littleHorse: Besides, why can't she just do it?",False
newCow: It also only REALLY works if you talk about the subject explicitly before getting married.,False
likelySquirrel: She isn't the asshole. She's working on a better life for everyone involved.,False
conventionalGorilla: I think she is an asshole because her husband is obviously unhappy.,False
"newCow: If she told him he was in for this type of treatment before hand, sure. ",False
conventionalGorilla: I think you have a responsibility to listen to your spouse.,False
newCow: But she probably didn't.,False
newCow: I think she's an asshole.,False
likelySquirrel: The husband has more free time and it's a way he can contribute to helping the family.,False
littleHorse: It's not his family though,False
"conventionalGorilla: I understand being busy with her Master's, but I don't understand why they...just can't talk about it?",False
littleHorse: He didn't marry his spouse's wife,False
conventionalGorilla: I feel like this could be solved with better communication tbh.,False
littleHorse: mother*,False
littleHorse: Yeah,False
likelySquirrel: He married her. They became family.,False
"littleHorse: It;'s not a huge deal, sit down, communicate and it could all be solved",False
"littleHorse: Exactly. He married her, to help take care of her, and his and her's kids. Not her mom",False
"likelySquirrel: There probably is a compromise that can be explored, but it doesn't make her an asshole.",False
newCow: I think we should all vote her the asshole either way.,False
"newCow: Even if she's not wrong, the idea is to be able to get along.",False
conventionalGorilla: I think she's the asshole because she thinks she's not wrong. She never mentioned her husband's feelings.,False
"littleHorse: I think to look at both sides, what likelySquirrel said would make sense but she's still an asshole",False
littleHorse: Exactly.,False
likelySquirrel: Family is about who came before AND after.,False
likelySquirrel: All generations should be considered,False
"littleHorse: Well, I wouldn't get married to anyone if it meant becoming a full time translator.",False
littleBear: i believe that you sholud always help out family.,False
"conventionalGorilla: I think that's a cultural difference,",False
likelySquirrel: littleHorse nobody said it's fulltime.,False
"littleHorse: You should help them out, but to a certain extent. Becoming a full time translator would be a no for me",False
"littleHorse: It is though, it explicitly sayus",False
littleHorse: she calls whenever she has a probblem,False
"littleHorse: hence, full time",False
littleBear: I would not want to be a translater,False
likelySquirrel: It's an occasional thing. He isn't following her around 24/7,False
littleHorse: But he;s on call 24/7.,False
littleBear: i dont think this person was an asshole,False
"littleHorse: If it was occasional, I'm sure he wouldn't be irrtated.",False
likelySquirrel: And it's just a phone call.,False
spryOrangutan: Hi!,False
littleSquirrel: Hello,False
smallRhino: hello!,False
"smallBear: Hey all, finally people!",False
snappyBison: hello.,False
spryOrangutan: yes finally!,False
spryOrangutan: So what do you guys think?,False
littleSquirrel: What's everyone first impression,False
snappyBison: I feel like everyone is the asshole lol.,False
spryOrangutan: I think the guy is the asshole in this instance,False
littleSquirrel: I think this one is tricky because there's some room for cultural miserunderstanding too,False
smallRhino: My initial thoughts are that she is not the asshole.,False
"smallBear: I do think it is a little unreasonable for her to expect her husband to field these calls all the time. It's one thing to pass the phone to him if she's with him and he agrees, but I would also be annoyed to get calls directly about it.",False
"smallRhino: I would be annoyed too, but I do think you marry into someone's family when you marry them",False
"smallBear: I get that very close-knit families of any culture would expect to always help out family, but marrying into it doesn't always bring that same kind of obligation",False
"snappyBison: Sure, but there has to be a limit.",False
snappyBison: At what point is the husband justified in refusing to translate any more?,False
smallRhino: That's true-- I guess it would help to know how often the family is actually bothering him. ,False
littleSquirrel: It does seem like she just assumed he would help - I wonder if that had a conversation where she shared what it felt like growing up if it would help ,False
smallBear: I think ideally they would stop calling him directly and she would ask each time she gets a call and is busy if he doesn't mind helping.,False
"smallRhino: I feel like 1-2 times a week is justified, but if it is everyday I think that would be a lot.",False
"spryOrangutan: Agree to the points above, its hard to expect the husband to always take the call and for the wife to not even screen",False
snappyBison: and shouldn't the wife understand / be willing to take his feelings into consideration?,False
"littleSquirrel: Translating can take a lot of mental energy too, it's not a quick thing",False
"smallBear: I also don't know how ""less busy"" the husband is - sometimes people with very physically busy jobs assume someone with mentally tasking jobs are ""less busy"".",False
spryOrangutan: They should just set filters and the wife should be more considerate about how the husband feels,False
snappyBison: Agreed,False
"smallRhino: very true-- I guess we don't really know the true circumstances, either. ",False
littleSquirrel: They could just hire people too to help translate,False
littleSquirrel: Might be a compromise somewhere,False
spryOrangutan: Or refer them to Google translate,False
spryOrangutan: haha or Alexa,False
smallBear: I think we have to agree yes or no if she is the asshole though.,False
spryOrangutan: she is the asshole IMO,False
"snappyBison: Well i feel like even though we're just being presented with the wife's side, we still feel like the husband is sort of justified",False
smallBear: Yes there are many apps for on-the-go voice translating now!,False
"snappyBison: so that makes her the asshole i think, no?",False
littleSquirrel: I don't think she's the asshole,False
smallBear: Using an app would do the same purpose as calling the husband,False
"snappyBison: idk, im with spryOrangutan i think she's the asshole",False
smallRhino: I kind of think she is too,False
"smallBear: I agree she is the asshole here, there has to be compromise.",False
smallRhino: I'd like to know how many times he is being called though. ,False
littleSquirrel: Yeah but I guess if we think shes the asshole then does 2 times a week versus 5 really matter,False
smallRhino: And she should still talk to her parents and ask them to call her first or send a text or something so it's more manageable. ,False
"spryOrangutan: yeah. there are a lot of details to consider but unfortunately, we can only go by what is in the text. Agree with shooting the quick text even before the call, the wife may not even know how much calls the husband is getting",False
"snappyBison: I think she is the asshole regardless of how many calls the husband is receiving, as it appears she is not taking his feelings into consideration.",False
"spryOrangutan: Im thinking that there would be a reason why suddenly, the husband called the situation into attention when previously it was fine",False
conventionalGorilla: hello!,False
smallBison: Hey guys.,False
spryRabbit: Hello! Nice to have someone to talk to about this,False
littleGoat: Hey again some of  you,False
spryRabbit: I feel like the guy is the asshole in this instance,False
snappyGiraffe: WOW! My first thought is this man is incredibly aggressive and an asshole. I felt very offended ,False
smallBison: Interesting case we have here. Initial thoughts?,False
"spryRabbit: I feel like there could have been other ways to voice his concern and while he may have been polite in talking to his wife's mother about it, it really does seem condescending",False
"conventionalGorilla: I think he is the asshole too-- I understand that he would want her to learn English, but from the way he spoke he had a very elitist attitude about it that didn't sit well with me.",False
"smallBison: Really?? I felt like he was not the asshole at all here. He comes across as very angry, but I felt like the way he handled it with the mother in law was not bad.",False
snappyGiraffe: I think he has some serious issues with anger and am scared for his wife! What could the other side be?,False
"littleGoat: So at first, I thought the way he said it was very asshole-ish, but I also know what it's like to vent on social media when the actual conversation was much more polite. ",False
"smallBison: Yes littleGoat I agree completely, that was my read on the situation as well.",False
littleGoat: It doesn't sound like anyone asked him if they could call him during the day to help translate. It sounds like he was trying to at least be helpful instead of just not answering the phone anymore,False
"conventionalGorilla: I guess it is good that he offered to help her and provided her with a whole host of resources that she could use to learn English, but it came off as very rude and as if he has a superiority complex.",False
spryRabbit: I did not particularly like his statement on how easily he can learn several language so he is expecting that learning English would be easy,False
"smallBison: I felt like he came across as an asshole to us the readers, but that he is actually justified in being frustrated and that he handled the situation very appropriately.",False
"snappyGiraffe: I think his ""helpfulness"" was just a way to continue being rude and racist ",False
"smallBison: Eh, if you read how he explained things to the mother in law, it doesnt seem to me like he was being rude or racist.",False
spryRabbit: Agree with sna,False
spryRabbit: sna,False
"littleGoat: Right, it's easy for us to call him an asshole based on the language he used in his posting. He could have just ignored them all and refused to help, but he at least tried. His mental judgments are crude to us but he was trying to...",False
spryRabbit: snappyGiraffe,False
spryRabbit: hahahaha,False
littleGoat: ...balance his reaction to being bothered but also trying to solve the problem instead of saying no and refusing to help.,False
snappyGiraffe: It is just so hard to see his side because it seems like he's just using the situationas an excuse to let his racism and general frusterations about wife and family spill over,False
"smallBison: Anyways, so yeah I think the guy's probably an asshole in real life, but in this situation i do not think he was the asshole.",False
"conventionalGorilla: True-- I think he should have reworded and it isn't necessarily racist to say she should learn English (not that it is an easy thing to do, but she struggled in certain situations and knowing English, regardless of race, would help her)",False
smallBison: Gotta vote not the asshole for this one.,False
"snappyGiraffe: I think he's the asshole, there's too many other ways he could have handled it",False
smallBison: such as?,False
snappyGiraffe: literally any other way,False
smallBison: such as?,False
"littleGoat: I don't think he is an asshole in this situation, even if he's an asshole on Reddit :)",False
"spryRabbit: I think if he had some thoughts, he could have said it to his wife so she can mediate or explain to him another side to go about it",False
littleGoat: I think they still would have thought he was an asshole if he just refused to help at all.,False
"snappyGiraffe: Not yell, not use racist language",False
smallBison: he didn't use racist language....,False
smallBison: what?,False
littleGoat: He didn't in the actual conversation with the MIL.,False
"snappyGiraffe: ""I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now""",False
snappyGiraffe: quote from him ,False
snappyGiraffe: Why does it matter if someone learns English?,False
littleGoat: He later clarified that.,False
smallBison: quote from him in his post. not in what he said to her..,False
"snappyGiraffe: he said ""I told her"" ....",False
smallBison: if you had read his edit at the bottom you'd have seen that.,False
snappyGiraffe: Yeah he said that after people had yelled at him,False
youngWolf: Hello,False
culturedCow: Hi,False

smallSquirrel: I think they should have included the mom in the conversation,False
culturedGiraffe: true ,False
youngBison: they off family,False
newRabbit: So in this case I don't think the poster is being an asshole. His husband is uncomfortable speaking in english and he is just trying to make him comfortable.,False
smallSquirrel: it is uncomfortable,False
culturedCow: My initial impression is the lady is an asshole,False
youngWolf: She could have maintained the english language policy,False
newRabbit: It seems like his husband probably doesn't speak proficient english. ,False
youngWolf: It was just for the weekend,False
youngBison: lady asshole,False
conventionalDonkey: I don't think she's an asshole for talking in German to her husband though,False
smallSquirrel: only for 1 weekend,False
culturedCow: She must have followed english language rather than german.,False
youngBison: the man have no happness,False
"newRabbit: When you all are saying she do you mean the mom? The original poster is male married to another male, just want to make sure I understand",False
smallSquirrel: yeah i do,False
conventionalDonkey: it's a man,False
newRabbit: So do you all think the mom or the son is the asshole?,False
"youngWolf: if the husband doesn't speak speak proficient English, it doesn't matter",False
smallSquirrel: son,False
youngBison: yes,False
conventionalDonkey: you're right it's a male.,False
youngBison: agree,False
conventionalDonkey: Either way she's going to be stuck translating between the two,False
youngBison: male is good,False
"culturedCow: Husband and wife both live together for life long. So they can speak German whenever they want. But while with family member for some time, they should follow what the member speaks.",False
newRabbit: There is no wife.,False
smallSquirrel: two men,False
youngBison: his mother also ,False
conventionalDonkey: since it seems like he's going to have problem speaking to the mom. Since he doesn't always no the right words,False
youngBison: wife is too bad,False
conventionalDonkey: This is a gay couple,False
culturedGiraffe: exactly.  He doesnt know the right words ,False

conventionalDonkey: so itll be hard either way,False
youngBison: attitude change,False
"newRabbit: Yeah that's the part that got me. I'm sure the son could speak to his mom also, just speaking in his husband's natural tongue to him",False
conventionalDonkey: ill feel like the mom will be asking her son what does your husband means all the time,False
youngBison: the man also bad,False
youngBison: over hope,False
culturedCow: Sorry for the mistake.,False
smallSquirrel: both of them ....but more so the mom,False
culturedGiraffe: its fine.  So is he goign to the the asshole or not?,False

"newRabbit: Once again, there is no wife. The question is going to be about the person who asked, not which one do we think is the asshole.",False
conventionalDonkey: yes,False
culturedGiraffe: that will be out defintie answer,False
youngBison: off us off german,False
"newRabbit: Cool, I can go with that. ",False

smallGorilla: so he finds it uncomfortable but there doesn't seem to be an actual barrier,False
niceBison: yeah ...compromise ...mother def cannot speak their lang ,False
snappyWolf: He can speak English. So there is no fault on mother's side. ,False
youngOrangutan: yes,False
culturedHippo: I believe its just for the weekend,False
"spryRabbit: Oh ok! He might be much more comfortable speaking in french, but they can continue to speak in french on their own time.",False
youngRhino: that true,False
niceBison: in their own time then they can,False
"culturedHippo: but they just had to make her life hell, throughout the weekend",False
youngOrangutan: should comfortable all,False
youngOrangutan: she is not goos,False

spryRabbit: She isn't good? She can't speak french.,False

spryRabbit: Can you give a reasoning youngOrangutan I want to understand where you're coming from.,False
"spryRabbit: I say mother is not asshole, but I'm willing to listen to arguments from the other side.",False
smallGorilla: I mean I guess she could not try and involve herself in their personal conversations maybe?,False
culturedHippo: i believe the mother is an asshole,False
niceBison: I say mother is not ....but i can listen,False
niceBison: why,False
youngOrangutan: as per argument  my openion i told,False
snappyWolf: I considered both the side and came to conclusion that mother is not asshole.,False
"smallGorilla: I'm for not the asshole, but that might be a reason for it",False
youngRhino: no she defeinetly isnt,False
culturedHippo: I mean mother is not an asshole,False
"spryRabbit: We have to talk about why, just saying you think the mother is an asshole isn't giving a reason.",False
youngRhino: i think they shoudl all just speka the same lanugue toghter,False
youngRhino: and chat in enlgish in private,False
youngOrangutan: that is correct,False
"spryRabbit: Son in law can speak english, he is choosing not to with the mother there",False
spryRabbit: youngOrangutan is english your first language?,False
youngOrangutan: why you asking,False
"snappyWolf: When everyone can speak a common language, it would be good and comfortable to speak in that language.",False
smallGorilla: like why is she trying to butt into their conversation kinda deal. If they want to talk to her then they'll switch to english? maybe thats what youngOrangutan means,False
spryRabbit: Because you're not making much sense,False
spryRabbit: That makes sense smallGorilla I could see how they would feel she is butting in,False
spryRabbit: But i also think it is extremely rude to purposefully exclude someone who is in the room with you,False
smallGorilla: I just feel if you're going to someone else homes to visit you should try and include them,False
smallGorilla: Like what's the point of visiting them then,False
spryRabbit: I agree. It's her home.,False
likelySquirrel: hi,False
spryGoat: hi,False
spryOrangutan: hi,False
newRhino: hello,False
"littleLion: Hi, so what did everyone think?",False
spryGoat: I think he did it in a respectful way,False
spryOrangutan: I think he's not the asshole.,False
spryGoat: As long as he wasn't nasty and offered to help her,False
newRhino: based on my perception he is definitely not an asshole,False
spryGoat: I don't think he was the asshole,False
"culturedHippo: he was respectful, even offered to help her locate the training she needed",False
youngCow: I think he was respectful. He even offered to help her learn.,False
"spryDonkey: i don't think he was an asshole. although it did come off a little mean initially, his updated edit said that he was being respectful",False
likelySquirrel: I think he is not an asshole,False
"littleLion: yeah i don't think he was an asshole, it's not fair to make him translate all the time like that",False
spryGoat: I agree,False
"spryOrangutan: He addressed her respectfully, despite feeling pretty aggravated, and he offered to help her.  Beyond that she has lived in the US for quite some time, so the fact that she doesn't speak conversational English is on her.",False
spryDonkey: my standpoint from this is they should learn english because what if no one is around to help them? what if it's an emergency?,False
spryGoat: exactly,False
culturedHippo: very true,False
newRhino: Agreed to some extent,False
"spryOrangutan: I'd understand her wanting help for the first few months of living here, but almost a decade after the fact is insane.",False
likelySquirrel: Because he tried in all way that he cold help her. ,False
"littleLion: yeah, i think it comes down to how he said it and he seems like he was respectful",False
spryGoat: they will be better off in the longrun if they learn english and not be so dependent on him,False
spryOrangutan: especially because he has his own life.,False
newRhino: they don't have to be fluent however basic skills should be good enough,False
newRhino: what do you think,False
spryDonkey: agreed ,False
spryOrangutan: I'd be angry if I was getting phone calls in the middle of the day.,False
spryGoat: It would definitely be frustrating,False
spryDonkey: and he provided resources to help,False
spryOrangutan: I totally agree. Being fluent isn't required by you need to be able to perform the most basic tasks.,False
likelySquirrel: Though he is not an asshole he must have helped on crucial times.,False
littleLion: I can't imagine getting calls at all hours of the day to help with menial tasks.,False
littleLion: It sounds like he has helped for a while too.,False
likelySquirrel: He didn't help all the time but he tried to help them in learning a language in some ways. For me he is not an asshole.,False
littleLion: I think after eight years it is fair to assume that you learn basic communications for day to day stuff and emergencies.,False
littleLion: And like you said he provided plenty of resources to help her learn.,False
snappyBison: She is the asshole.,False
youngOrangutan: Hi,False
spryPig: Hi.,False
conventionalRabbit: Hello,True
spryMonkey: hi,False
spryPig: I think she is the asshole because she shouldn't be making her husband translate..it's her family.,False
"niceLion: For this scenario, I can understand that it's family and he should help a bit, but I'm calling her the asshole. It's a one sided conversation!",False
nicePanda: i think she's an asshole for putting her problems onto her husband ,False
niceLion: she's basically forcing him to translate at her mom's leisure or face social consequences,False
conventionalRabbit: She is an asshole to put too much pressure on her husband,True
youngOrangutan: My initial impression is she is not an asshole. She has no time to help her parents. ,False
spryMonkey: I think she's an asshole for assuming he'd handle it. Yes it's his extended family but it's her mother. He has a life too.,False
spryPig: But i'm sure her husband has other things to do as well,False
nicePanda: and the parents should learn english especially if they can't even read a menu.. how will they deal with emergencies when no one is available?,False
"niceLion: Beyond that, I'm calling her out for using 'privilege' as means to explain why her parents shouldn't feel obligated to pick up some solid conversational english",False
snappyBison: They have been there for eyars. Her mother should have picked up at least a few words of English to get through her usual errands and to do list items. ,False
nicePanda: agreed,False
snappyBison: Not to have done so is simply lazy or a willful resistance to making her life and everyone else's life easier. ,False
"littleHippo: I agree as well, parents have had time to learn English and wife only assumes husband has free time",False
spryMonkey: I just don't see why it's his responsibility... sometimes is okay but she shouldn't be oawning it off like that.,False
niceLion: she's privilege baiting and that makes her the asshole,False
youngOrangutan: But she can't learn the entire language right!!,False
conventionalRabbit: I totally agree given the scenario because laziness is not an excuse,True
niceLion: ^,False
spryPig: he would probably help her learn english..then she wouldn't need the translations so much,False
spryPig: But it's not his responsibility,False
"youngOrangutan: If she has time, then she would help her parents. ",False
niceLion: He has clearly cared enough to learn Spanish to the extent that he can translate for her,False
niceLion: why can't she do the same?,False
conventionalRabbit: yeah it is not his responsibility ,True
nicePanda: OO this was good,False
nicePanda: agreed with niceLion,False
spryPig: I agree as well..,False
conventionalRabbit: however he can take initiative volunteerily,True
youngOrangutan: It's not the fact about responsibility. Its just a matter between family bonding.,False
"niceLion: I get that, but volunteering means you choose to help",False
"spryPig: He probably would be happy to teach her..but not be ""on call"" all the time.",False
niceLion: He's not getting a choice on when/how he helps. It's being thrown in his lap,False
"littleHippo: from what I can tell husband has already helped, it's not like he is saying no right off the bat. But it's starting to be too much",False
spryMonkey: I understand him getting frustrated and I don't think he has an issue helping from time to time... it's an issue getting called upon all the time because his SO is doing her master's,False
"spryPig: Right, he's happy to help..but to a certain extent...",False
"youngOrangutan: If not him, then who else can help them?",False
nicePanda: yeah it seems like he's helped a decent amount but he's been pushed too far,False
niceLion: they should be able to help themselves,False
"spryPig: She should make the time to help her mother, it's her mother.",False
"spryMonkey: He's already met them halfway by learning the language, and they seem to be taking advantage of that",False
"niceLion: I would understand for more complicated items, but if you've been here for that long...Sorry, learn the language where you live",False
niceLion: it's not a race/privilege thing. It's a matter of being a good steward for yourself and your community,False
"spryMonkey: At the very least learn menu items, and simple things in case of emergency",False
"spryPig: I agree, they need to learn the language, enough to be able to let someone know your wants, etc",False
nicePanda: all about emergencies and what happens when no one is there to translate for you,False
culturedBear: i  really dont feel like she did anything wrong,False
"snappyLion: I said yes because even though it is not really a big dead, they should at least be a little more respectful around his mother.",False
littleRhino: so who thinks he is an asshole?,False
"snappyGorilla: Although the person wanted to make her husband comfortable, I think she could have done that in a better way. Why didn't she just have the conversation in German + English?",False
"spryCow: I believe she's the asshole. It's fine for them to speak German in private to make him comfortable, but doing it with her mother around makes it seem like she's being excluded.",False
snappyLion: Why can't they just talk in German when by themselves?,False
culturedBear: if she did it all the time though yeah,False
snappyGorilla: Yeah like why would you leave the mother out of a conversation??,False
culturedBear: how often does she live in USA,False
snappyGorilla: that doesn't really matter though,False
spryCow: It might come down to how often the husband has talked to the mother I guess,False
littlePanda: They have several opinions to consider both of them,False
snappyLion: Yeah I'd say like around the dinner table to just talk in English.,False
snappyGorilla: The prompt made it sound like they were having conversations in German in front of the mother. Which is bad,False
littleRhino: the mother was kind enough to let them stay there. the least he could do is include her in the conversation by at least translating what they are saying or just speaking English since they are guests in her house,False
spryCow: I'd have to agree there,False
snappyGorilla: me too,False
"snappyLion: Yeah I don't think they are major assholes, but still acting a bit selfish.",False
culturedBear: i  agree too,False
littlePanda: I would agree that portion to expose that women point of view,False
snappyGorilla: so are we voting asshole or no,False
youngBison: I think they are both a bit wrong because she misses her son.  The husband shold bend a bit in her house.,False
littleRhino: and explain to the mother that he doesn't feel comfortable speaking English because he messes up on some words,False
littleRhino: I say asshole,False
snappyGorilla: Me too,False
youngBison: me too,False
spryCow: Yes,False
snappyLion: yep,False
culturedBear: same,False
littlePanda: It was quite good to expose that in-front of mom,False
"littleRhino: I love my name...small pig...like, really? lol",False
"snappyLion: wait, i see you as littleRhino",False
culturedBear: i  see you as that too omg,False
culturedBear: am i  culturedBear,False
"littleRhino: pigs arent normally small, and bears arent really cultured lol",False
"youngBison: whats the point of coming home to visit if they arent catching up, you know? haha :)",False
"newDonkey: To me, the mother was very kind in what she said so she isn't an asshole",False
youngHorse: I'm thinking yes because he seem to be overreacting,False
culturedSquirrel: I feel like the mother was in the wrong to stop their conversation.,False
conventionalRhino: She might have overreacted a bit but I don't think she's an asshole.,False
conventionalRhino: As guests they should try and include her,False
likelyGiraffe: that was kinda mean,False
"newDonkey: I don't think the mother did anything wrong. How would you feel if you were sitting in a room with two people speaking a different language? If it was private, then they could say that. ",False
niceCow: I don't think the mom is the asshole in this...imagine if you were in a room with others and they started speaking another language knowing you dont know what they are saying...she is the one who should feel awkward not them..,False
newDonkey: exactly!,False
littleBear: I feel good to finished their conversation,False
culturedSquirrel: I feel like more information is needed. Was it just this one time they did not include her? ,False
newDonkey: idk,False
culturedSquirrel: Was it a one time conversation they slipped in and she got angry?,False
youngHorse: I guess the way I'm reading it is they were occasionally talking in a different language and not purposely doing it all the time,False
newDonkey: she wasn't angry though. ,False
niceCow: doesnt matter if it was one time or 100 times. ,False
conventionalRhino: Right it sounds like her son's partner had barely said anything in english the whole time,False
culturedSquirrel: its hard to tell on this one. In this one instance I feel she overreacted and was the asshole. ,False
niceCow: she would still feel like they were talking about her or something,False
newDonkey: she nicely told them how she felt. She didn't yell or anything,False
littleBear: It doesn't matter at all,False
"newDonkey: If she was rude, then yes, this could be considered an asshole situation, but she wasn't rude at all. The prompt says she ""said nicely""",False
culturedSquirrel: Its hard to tell here,False
littleBear: To be fill their feelings in that time.,False
"youngHorse: ""If she was rude, then yes, this could be considered an asshole situation, but she wasn't rude at all. The prompt says she ""said nicely"""" because of this I'm leaning to non-asshole",False
niceCow: she isn't the asshole...she told them how she felt and her opinion on the subject...,False
newDonkey: I'm leaning to non-asshole also,False
conventionalRhino: Same,False
littleBear: Yeah i accept,False
niceCow: but wasn't an asshole about it,False
likelyGiraffe: i  agree,False
culturedSquirrel: Ok - I could really go eitehr way here. I dont feel like I know enough about the weekend ,False
littleBear: So consider their points ,False
"niceCow: if it was my son doing that in my house I would be an asshole...slap him upside his head and tell him stop talking in a language I dont understand...it's my house my rules, english only lol",False
newDonkey: she mother was very nice about it ,False
newDonkey: the*,False
niceCow: she was better than me in this scenario lol,False
culturedSquirrel: but did she overreact?,False
niceCow: nope,False
niceCow: she was polite and told them her feelings on it,False
niceCow: that's not being an asshole thats being honest,False
newDonkey: exaclty,False
"culturedOrangutan: My initial impression is that no the father is not an asshole, it is his house, and his son's husband should respect that.",False
smallPanda: It's tricky. This person is kind of yes and kind of not an asshole,False
newGiraffe: My impression is that it could go either way also.,True
niceMonkey: I don't really feel like anyone in the asshole in this situation. the parent does have the right to feel comfortable and included in conversations in their own home but what if the son's partner is uncomfortable with his English skills?,False
"youngGoat: It's understandable that since it's his house he would want other people staying there to speak the same language, but my issue here is that the conversation was between his son and his son's partner.",False
"culturedOrangutan: I think the father went about it in the wrong way, but I do not think he is a straight up asshole for it. ",False
"spryWolf: I think it doesn't have much to do with the fact that it's OP's house, but more that the father is being excluded even though they were all in the same room together",False
"newBear: I believe that person isn't an asshole, because the other people need to realize that there is another person there and include him in the conversation.",False
"youngGoat: Obviously if the father was included in the conversation, they'd speak English presumably... ",False
"culturedOrangutan: Yes, they should of told the father what they were talking about, not just simply walked away. ",False
niceMonkey: do you always have conversations with everyone in the room at the same time as you? the son and the partner might have been discussing something between the two of them,False
newGiraffe: Could the son's partner not understand English enough that he would also be excluded if the conversation were in English?,True
culturedOrangutan: The son's partner did speak English I believe ,False
"spryWolf: The original text says the partner can speak English, so I presume that the partner is fluent enough.",False
"culturedOrangutan: I agree, I never have conversations with everyone in the room at home, sometimes it can just be a personal conversation ",False
"smallPanda: As host, he could have the respect to allow them to talk in french. Maybe the partner is more comfortable using his native language, and we don't know how much or difficult it is for him to speak english.",False
"niceMonkey: I still don't think the parent is the asshole though, even if the conversation that triggered all this was personal between the son and partner.",False
newBear: Maybe they were trying to plan something to suprise him?,False
"youngGoat: Usually on reddit there's an option to say no one's the asshole here, but we do have to choose.",False
newGiraffe: I believe the parent should have been less direct and not accuse them of disrespect.,True
youngGoat: I would definitely say the father.,False
"culturedOrangutan: I would say he is not, I think there was just a misunderstanding",False
spryWolf: We can guess all we want about their intentions for speaking French but we only have the original text.,False
"newBear: I say no, that he isn't an asshole.",False
smallPanda: I say not an asshole,False
"culturedOrangutan: Yes, I believe he should of been less direct, but he is not a asshole",False
niceMonkey: ultimately I agree it was more of a misunderstanding then straight asshole behavior. he just went about expressing his discomfort in an awkward way.,False
niceMonkey: not the asshole,False
"spryWolf: I believe that OP not an asshole, but definitely could have handled it better.",False
"newBear: I say no, he isn't an asshole.",False
newGiraffe: I agree with spryWolf,True
youngGoat: I just think how he approached it was quite close minded.,False
conventionalGiraffe: If the conversation concerns her then obviously they will speak English but I'm sure they want to talk to each other since they're partners. She can't make her husband feel left out or he'll never want to come back again. ,False
spryOrangutan: I believe the son should have been a translator making both parties comfortable.,False
conventionalGiraffe: NTA,False
youngBear: so I don't think this person is an asshole at all. he's walking a fine line trying to make his husband comfortable but also include his mom.,False
smallRabbit: I think she was in a tough spot with trying to please her mom and husband.,False
"snappySquirrel: I don't think she's an asshole, but maybe she could translate if it makes her mom feel better. ",False
likelyHippo: Yeah I think OP is making a sincere effort to consider both sides,False
youngBear: I agree with conventionalGiraffe if the conversation concerns mom they should speak English but otherwise it's kind of him to want his husband to feel comfortable,False
newLion: I think she is in a situation where she has to choose between her mom and husband and thats not really fair,False
smallRabbit: I don't think she was an asshole either.,False
newLion: I think maybe she should of explained the situation to her mother beforehand,False
likelyHippo: I agree with snappySquirrel translating might have been better.,False
"newLion: but she is not an asshole for doing it, she was just looking out for her husband",False
"conventionalGiraffe: The best she could do is divide her attention better, but definitely not an asshole.",False
spryOrangutan: I think the mother could have had private time to catch up and then no one would have been in a bad situation.,False
"youngBear: yeah, I think some simple explanation would go a long way. he could simply tell his mom his husband is shy about his English",False
youngBear: no one is the asshole though. so I say NTA,False
"newLion: Agreed, not an asshole, just a misunderstanding.",False
smallRabbit: I think maybe they could of came up with a plan and help each other learn each other language.,False
snappySquirrel: For sure could also have had one on one time with mother as well. I agree with youngBear that no one was really an asshole here.,False
smallRabbit: Then all of them could try to be more comfortable with the other language.,False
"likelyHippo: Agreed, no assholes here.",False
spryOrangutan: No one was really an asshole. They just need to learn how to deal with the situation better.,False
"newLion: Yes, if they come up with a plan beforehand and explain both sides, I would see no problem.",False
smallRabbit: I agree. She wasn't an asshole.,False
conventionalGiraffe: Agreed.,False
likelyPig: If he' actually said ',False
youngCow: He's an asshole,False
spryLion: I think this person was not being an asshole if he was being polite about it,False
littleHippo: At first I did think this person was the asshole but I can see both sides of the picture here.  ,False
youngCow: He didn't approach it in the right way,False
"likelyPig: If he'd actually said ""I'm tired of your shit"", he'd be an asshole. But he tried to help her.",False
"likelyRabbit: I understand learning a new language is difficult and there isn't an official language in the USA, but learning English would be beneficial for her.",False
snappyGiraffe: He definitely is expecting a lot. Not everyone can learn new languages,False
niceRhino: I don't necessarily think what he said was wrong but the way he said it made him an asshole.  ,False
"spryLion: He felt taken advantage of, so he voiced his opinon",False
snappyGiraffe: and the difference in ages is a factor,False
likelyPig: She's not his responsibility. ,False
"snappyGiraffe: It seems like he got super frustrated, and lashed out about it one day.",False
"niceRhino: Also, learning a new language is not as easy as he is making it sound. ",False
"youngCow: Think about the mother though, was she brought here?  How old is she?  how hard is it to learn a whole new language when you're already like 60",False
littleHippo: I agree not everyone can learn languages and the way he went about it was def wrong.  I would think its harder for an older person to learn the language,False
likelyRabbit: I can imagine how annoying it would get having to be a translator everyday.,False
spryLion: But she can not always rely on him for basic needs,False
"youngCow: Yeah, he bottled it up, and rage-unleashed it",False
niceRhino: He also stated that she tries to call other family members before calling him.  Seems like he is a last resort.,False
"youngCow: so for that, he's an asshole, even if he tried to smooth it over",False
likelyRabbit: She could use Google translate or get a translation book.,False
likelyPig: Calling him a racist for not getting their way makes them unrespectable. ,False
littleHippo: there are so many resources like apps she could use for basic things,False
"niceRhino: I agree, maybe he should have informed her of Google translate.",False
likelyPig: There are translation apps.,False
spryLion: She does not have to become fluent in order to learn basic phrases to get by,False
"youngCow: yeah, translation apps would have helped",False
"littleHippo: I agree the racist, trump supporting comments were totally unnecessary",False
youngCow: I just don't think he considered her learning situation,False
likelyRabbit: It is best for her and for him if she learned basic English.,False
"youngCow: yes, the trump stuff was very unnecessary",False
"niceRhino: Yes, he did not seem racist, just an asshole. But not by what he said, how he went about it. ",False
"snappyGiraffe: Yeah, because it seems like he was suggesting learning english out of an actual necessity since she can't do basics alone.",False
"likelyRabbit: Learning a new language is hard, but she needs to try.",False
littleHippo: and it depends how often she is calling for translation.  ,False
likelyPig: They seem entitled. He was doing it as a favor,False
niceRhino: Maybe he should have involved his wife in the conversation.,False
snappyGiraffe: He offered to help her learn,False
"youngCow: Yes, involving his wife would have helped",False
likelyPig:  @niceRhino Then he'd be an asshole,False
"snappyGiraffe: In terms of showing her the tools he used, and promising to help her along the way",False
youngCow: He was nice enough to provide other resources too.,False
"spryLion: He should have involved his wife, but as long as he addressed his MIL in a respectful way, I don't think there is anything wrong with him telling her this",False
likelyPig: agree,False
littleHippo: But then does she have access to a phone with apps because i know many older people have no clue how to use technology.  His wife def should be involved in this conversation,False
youngCow: Agree,False
niceRhino: Maybe not @likelyPig. She could have helped the conversation ,False
niceRhino: Agree,False
likelyPig: she's got the phone if she calls him from places,False
spryLion: true,False
"youngCow: He handled it poorly, which is why he is the asshole in this scenario.  Really so are the family members for calling him a trumper, but it feels like he could have had better control of it.",False
likelyPig: and they make simple phones especially for older people,False
"likelyRabbit: I think he handled it well, he just didn't word it well in the post.",False
"niceRhino: Yes, the family seemed to turn on him quickly which makes me think he did not handle it well. ",False
"spryLion: In his edit he said he did not address her in the way he intially explained, so I dont think he was being an asshole",False
likelyRabbit: He is not the asshole because he was thinking of what is best for her and him.,False
likelyPig: agree. posted poorly,False
niceRhino: I think that he is the asshole for the way he handled the situation.  ,False
likelyRabbit: He handled it well,False
"littleHippo: The wife could have helped the conversation go smoother and be less of an ""attack"" towards the mother, if she agreed with him that is.",False
snappyGiraffe: He clearly was frustrated when he wrote the post,False
"youngCow: I think he is an asshole too.  Well intentioned, but still an asshole",False
littleHippo: youngCow agree,False

culturedGorilla: The husband also did not say anything bad.  He gave ideas and other options to try to help.  He was not rude. ,False
culturedOrangutan: The wife is def the asshole in the situation and should have not pushed this off because he has more free time.,False
niceHippo: Helping is one thing. But they are having him do it for them instead of learning.,False
"culturedOrangutan: He also did not confront the parents here, he is having the conversation with his wife about it.  ",False

culturedOrangutan: agreed,False

newPanda: Agreed,False
culturedOrangutan: I can understand translating important documents but def not menus and simple things. They should learn the basics andnot just be relying,False
"snappyBear: The wife's excuse that she doesn't have enough time and her husband does is weak.  It's her family, and yes, he married into it, but he married her first and foremost",False
"snappyBear: That said, being in a new country, and learning a new language is always difficult",False
"newPanda: Yes, he married for her companionship, not to work as a translator",False
culturedGorilla: The first few sentences she says how they make fun of her husband.  It seems like the wife has an us vs. him mentality and her husband is not a part of her team,False

newCow: Agreed,False

"conventionalRabbit: Those are definitely the ""mean jokes""",False

"snappyBear: Yeah, if she understood why he got married in the first place, this would have been smoother for the both of them.",False

"snappyLion: I agree, at least how to order in a restaurant ",False

culturedPig: Yea he doesn't mention his wife much at all!,False
"snappyWolf: Yes, the mother in law should be learning English, its not fair to rely on him to always translate",False
snappyLion: I would say he is not the asshole,False
littleHippo: At this point they are enabling her. She has gotten so used to knowing that others will help so why she should she learn the language?,False
culturedCow: She does not owe anyone language skills,False

snappyMonkey: It is the daughter/wife,False
nicePanda: I don't think it's unfair to ask the mother to learn some English to at least get by,False
snappyMonkey: I agree,False
"niceCow: Its fair enough for the son to ask his husband to help if he was super busy, but slightly unfair to always make his husband do it",False
niceSquirrel: If he know longer wants to do this then his feelings show be accepted,False
niceRhino: I think the daughter needs to take some responsibility here,False
"snappyMonkey: she's been here for years, at first the husband can help but at what point is it enabling the mother",False
niceCow: I don't think it would be bad for the mother to also learn english,False
niceSquirrel: yes I agree,False
niceCow: or at least some english,False
snappyMonkey: i agree,False
"likelyGoat: I think that he should help out, but he should not be forced/expected to help all the time. She should make that her priority since he is communicating he no longer wants to. ",False
niceCow: I agree,False
"smallPig: I don't see the big deal in helping ones mother in-law, but on second thought if the doesn't want to do it,she should do  it herself",False

"newMonkey: Hi, my initial impression is that the writer is the asshole.",False
"smallCow: Yes, I agree that the writer is the asshole as well.",False
"snappyWolf: Hello, that's my impression as well.",False
culturedSquirrel: I agree. I think she is making a big deal out of nothing.,False
niceHippo: I believe the mother is be the asshole. ,False
"conventionalOrangutan: My first impression is that the parent isn't the asshole, particularly.",False
newMonkey: I think they are the asshole primarily because they could have had a private discussion or asked to learn a few phrases in French so that they could feel included.,False
niceHippo: I don’t think communicating in a native language is being disrespectful. ,False
conventionalOrangutan: I can understand that they want to be included in at least SOME conversations. But I agree newMonkey they should have spoken more privately about it,False
niceHippo: If the mother felt left out she should of approached it differently. ,False
"smallCow: Yes, my thoughts exactly niceHippo",False
"snappyWolf: Yea, I think I would be okay with it if she talked to him privately first.",False
culturedSquirrel: Yep. I would feel awkward talking in a foreign language (english) if I speak French to my husband. But don't mind if was asked nicely.,False
"smallCow: I think that she is the asshole because she is assuming that they don't want to include her, but perhaps they just assumed that she would not mind them talking in French.",False
conventionalOrangutan: I agree somewhat niceHippo -- But I don't think she's an asshole about it?,False
niceHippo: She could of simply asked what they were talking about as to engage them both.,False
"conventionalOrangutan: I guess I see that calling it ""disrespectful"" is asshole-ish",False
"smallCow: Yeah, there is some grey area, but I am leaning towards asshole a little more than not the asshole.",False
"newMonkey: I agree, I think the situation was handled poorly. There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to feel included but it could have been approached in a kinder way",False
"snappyWolf: For me it mostly depends how she worded it, but i'm leaning more towards asshole based on the post.",False
newMonkey: And there's evident entitlement that comes from assuming other people should work to speak your language. She could always make an effort as well ,False
"conventionalOrangutan: I'm sort of ambivalent. It's just a communication issue, neither side is wrong. You all are on the same page and I feel fine about that *shrug*",False
"niceHippo: Bottom line, there were lots of other positives ways to approach the subject without giving an air of superiority with the wording “disrespectful “.",False
conventionalOrangutan: good point newMonkey,False
niceHippo: The mother came off an asshole. ,False
"smallCow: The way she handled it was a bit distasteful, so I think that she was the asshole. She could have suggested for them to speak English more, instead of demanding it.",False
conventionalOrangutan: I voted yes in the end.,False
"littleSquirrel: I think the writer is correct, it's her choice what language to speak",False
"youngRabbit: I agree, I do not think this person is the asshole",False
littleSquirrel: And she is not the asshole.,False
snappyHorse: I think the daughter was a bit of an asshole.,False
"culturedPig: I agree, I feel she should've talked to him first instead of just calling him a asshole if she had a problem.",False
"littleSquirrel: Oops sorry, the writer is a man, the son.",False
newPanda: I agree. He choose to make his husband comfortable and I don't see anything wrong with that,True
littleSquirrel: Snapp,False
"youngRabbit: I think the mother knows that they are together (and if they are married, will hopefully be together for a long time), then she should make an effort to learn german or she should not complain",False
"snappyHorse: The daughter felt she had to “chose” between the hubby and mom, why chose both and translate?",False
"newOrangutan: I disagree with that, I think that since he is a guest in his mother's house they should be a little more respectful towards her wishes.",False
"newOrangutan: If they have a problem with speaking English then maybe they should talk to her about that, but I feel like he should have talked to her about this first before he made that decision.",False
youngRabbit: It is definitely a fair point that it is her house but I do not think speaking in a native language should ever be interpreted as being disrespectful ,False
littleSquirrel: snappyHorse Translation can be difficult and exhausting. Although I agree there could have been more compromise.,False
newPanda: The mother can just ask what they mean or ask the son to translate without calling him out.,True
"newOrangutan: True, but that might get really awkward for a long conversation.",False
newOrangutan: They should definitely seek some sort of middle ground here.,False
"youngRabbit: Right, it would be awkward to have a translation. But the husband has indicated that it is awkward for him to speak english.",False
littleSquirrel: I think because it is the mother's house it's even more uncomfortable for the husband. Speaking English and being in not your own family's home is double uncomfortable,False
snappyHorse: The mom hasn’t seen her daughter in years so why can’t the daughter speak English with her mom and have the son practice his English by speaking with her as well?,False
youngRabbit: I don't feel like one person's comfort is more important than another's. I think she could learn to speak German as well,False
"culturedPig: If he doesn't want to translate, he could've also spent some time talking English as well, instead of just German to make her feel included.",False
snappyHorse: I think it’s selfish of the daughter to cater to her husband ignoring her own mother as they haven’t seen each other in years. ,False
snappyHorse: Daughter is definitely an asshole.,False
newOrangutan: Agreed snappyHorse,False

youngOrangutan: she was nice to have them,False
newCow: i dont think so either,False
niceHippo: She was just asking in a public setting where everyone was to just speak in a language that everybody understands so nobody feels left out. ,False

smallBison: They are in a shared area of the house,False
likelyPig: Hello. That is a great point smallBison,False

niceHippo: Yes!,False
smallBison: It is a general rule that you should not speak other language to other people when they can't understand you. That's rude.,False

"youngOrangutan: they were going to be with her for a week i couldnt imagine a week with them if that is how it is going to be, how rude of her son.",False

likelyPig: Yeah it is not a big deal,False
"smallBison: yes, he left the living room and went upstairs. He should have apologize",False
likelyPig: In my opinion,False
newCow: my conclusion is that person is an asshole and he should understand his dad's opinion.,False
likelyPig: They should have talked it out more,False
youngOrangutan: exactly he shouldnt of been so rude. ,False
niceHippo: Yes there was way to communicate but they just shut down ,False
smallMonkey: newCow - the person is the parent and not the son. ,False

"littleDonkey: her husband is supposed to help his inlaw, which is no big deal",False
smallRabbit: both parties have to compromise,False
"smallGorilla: I don't think this person is an asshole, just a little out of touch. She and her husband aren't on the same page with what family means. I didn't like the comment about learning English; while she has a point, her spouse learned Spanish.",False
smallRabbit: both sides are responsible to make each other feel comfortable. ,False
"smallGorilla: Agree, smallRabbit Maybe they should share the responsibility.",False
littleBison: the husbands comment does seem rude. i think everyone sucks here,False
littleBison: in the scenario,False
littleDonkey: the husband could sacrifice some time to help her mom or better still pay fro a translation class for her,False
smallGorilla: little,False
newPanda: The wife should also make an effort to be available to help her mom. But the husband can help out too.,False
"smallRabbit: so I don't think they are assholes, but each of them can do a little better to be more considerate",False
"smallGoat: Nobody is perfect in the situation, but except for the husband's comment, nobody is really a huge asshole",False
likelyGiraffe: Its clear they both have expectations. They arent communicating what that is until it builds up,False
smallGorilla: Sorry. littleDonkey it sounds like he already does. It just is more often then he wishes. Or is more than he expects to invest in a family relationship. The term family can be overrated.,False
littleDonkey: well she should tell her husband to help out,False
littleDonkey: yes the person is an asshole,False
"smallGorilla: littleDonkey I'm glad (sincerely) that you have family you can depend on. Not everyone grew up that way, so the expectation of it in return can be a bit uncomfortable.",False
"newPig: When you marry, you don't just marry a person, you marry their family. Helping his wife's family ""every once in a while"" should not be a problem. ",False
likelyGiraffe: She didnt seem to make any asshole comments,False
"likelyBear: this person is definitely an asshole. they sound rude, racist, intense, and quite angry for what is going on.",False
smallBison: The guy is being an asshole,False
"likelyWolf: i feel the man has issues, he was just being rude",False
smallPanda: Definitely an asshole to me. She calls him as a last resort and he is angry about it.,False
"likelyRabbit: I agree that this man is being insensitive and disrectful. In other words, he's being an asshole.",False
likelyWolf: i agrree smallPanda definitely an asshole,False
"youngGorilla: my position stands that he is not an asshole. As i mentioned earlier, he has been doing it for 8 years.  it's not like he never helps.",False
"spryGiraffe: I think that he was very frustrated when he wrote the post, but I am willing to believe he was respectful to his MIL. It sounds like it happens all the time. People should make an effort to be independent, then ask for help if needed. ",False
youngGorilla: he has been helping for 8 years and the other party just took him for granted.,False
smallBison: He is not understanding that different people simply cant learn at the same rate as what hes used to. He could have taken a different approach,False
"spryGiraffe: smallBison I don't think he expects her to become fluent, just to try.",False
youngGorilla: i understand it's very difficult for the elderly to learn a new language. both sides need to share some responsibilityes ,False
"likelyRabbit: She's also most likely elderly, so she deserves additional respect and patience.",False
"newSquirrel: Reading his side, makes me more convinced that the wife was in the right. He speaks FOUR languages so obviously he has a good linguistic ability. Just because he was able to learn three additional languages, doesn't mean it is as easy",False
spryGiraffe: news,False
"likelyWolf: the man is just rude , there is no harm is helping out",False
likelyRabbit: I agree.,False
youngGorilla: he is an asshole IF HE NEVER helps. but please remember he has been helping for 8 years,False
newSquirrel: for others to do the same. He needs to come step back and think about how his actions have hurt his family.,False
"spryGiraffe: Sorry guys, having trouble with the autocomplete. newSquirrel Do you think it is reasonable to expect her to attempt to learn English? Results not guaranteed?",False
likelyBear: i think he sounds very aggressive and rude,False
likelyBear: a kinder person would be more calm and rational and communicative,False
"smallPanda: They say that language is easier to learn when you are younger as well. Not impossible to learn a new one when you're older, but it has something to do with the brain.",False
spryGiraffe: The thing I'm stuck on is that she isn't even trying to become independent. That bothers me.,False
newSquirrel: Correct smallPanda He needs some compassion,False
"youngGorilla: i agree he is rude, but as he said he was very frustrated. people say bad things in those situation.",False
"newSquirrel: Sure, he could have been having a bad day and just wasn't in the mental mind set to help her.",False
spryGiraffe: youngGorilla I'm on the same page. I suspect he was kinder to his family than his post suggests.,False
newSquirrel: He sure made himself out to sound like a jerk!,False
"youngGorilla: he is far from perfect, but he is not a complete asshole to me.",False
"spryGiraffe: While I understand the arguments about age and language acquisition, I'm still not convinced he is an asshole, just frustrated and human.",False
youngGorilla: totally agree with spryGiraffe,False
smallBison: Definition of asshole people,False
spryMonkey: I don't think this person is an asshole. I do think however that he could privately discuss the situation with his mom and husband separately to come to an understanding. ,False
newRabbit: I understand wanting to make your husband feel comforatble but to exclude his mom is wrong. ,False
"conventionalRhino: My initial opinion is that this person is the asshole. They spend part of the year in the US, and this appears to be one of a few weekends they spend with their mother. I feel like they could have mediated a conversation between all parties",False
conventionalBison: This is a tricky situation. I think of the German husband would simply say that he wants his husband to enjoy time with mom it would be great.,False
newCow: Hi guys! This scenario honestly reminds me off myself because I am in a bilingual family. I think this scenario in particular is difficult because more than one person is involved. If I had to choose I do think the poster is an asshole. ,False
smallLion: I feel like this person has some remorse over the decision but inevitably decided to be inflexible and please one person instead of compromise.,False
"likelyPig: I don't think this person is an asshole.  They are in a tough position, but need to make their spouse feel comfortable",False
newCow: The poster should have told her husband to speak English! English is the common language amongst the three. Even if the husband is uncomfortable he should do it so that the mom is not left out. ,False
newRabbit: the husband could have participated in the conversation in english but the mother did not have that option,False
likelyPig: He could have spoken to his mother prior to the visit to prep the sitiuation,False
"spryMonkey: Well, they could explain to their spouse and let them know the situation. Germany might have different social etiquette than america. ",False
conventionalRhino: He could express to his husband that he will learn english better with practice,False
likelyPig: Over time he would have felt more comfortable speaking German with her.  ,False
conventionalBison: The mother is the gracious hostess. It should be English. Honor mother and father..,False
"spryMonkey: True. The husband could have interjected at any English point, but the mom most likely doesn't speak any German. ",False
"snappyGoat: she is an asshole, they are only going to be there for a little time they can have their private moment in their room",False
likelyPig: I can understand not wanting his bad language to impact first impression?,False
newCow: Yeah good point! They are at the mom's house so they should definitely honor her language preference. ,False
smallLion: I feel that this person is somewhere between asshole and not and needs to address it with both parties and find compromise,False
likelyPig: and dishonor his?,False
conventionalRhino: He spends the other half of the year honoring his language preference in germany,False
conventionalRhino: and apparently plenty of time in the US as well,False
likelyPig: HE could have honored he by preparing her for the fact that he was going to be speaking german.,False
conventionalBison: I think he is trapped between the two.,False
"spryMonkey: I guess I could consider this guy the ""asshole"" he thinks he might be. More like in an uncomfortable situation where there isn't much communication going on.Is there an underlying reason in family history ",False
conventionalRhino: And letting his mom cook for them with no interaction in her language,False
spryMonkey: that the husband doesn't want to use english,False
newRabbit: I see both sides but i just feel if the husband lives some in the US then he could have easily spoke english,False
spryMonkey: How should we vote?,False
spryMonkey: asshole or no?,False
"likelyPig: Both sides have valid points, but need to come to an understanding that they can't do whats best for both.",False
newRabbit: the asshole,False
likelyPig: lets vote,False
"spryMonkey: ok, any other votes?",False
conventionalBison: Shame neither is more understanding. Asshole if English asshole with German. Lose lose situation.,False
smallLion: If can't at least try sometimes and his husband is just going to support that decision and that's that. Than he's the asshole. ,False
newCow: I think it's difficult. I also think the poster could be seen as both. But I am leaning towards asshole ,False
spryMonkey: asshole,False
likelyPig: asshole,False
conventionalRhino: I vote asshole,False
conventionalBison: Asshole,False
likelyPig: Looks like asshole,False
spryMonkey: we need the other 4 votes,False
smallLion: leaning toward asshole as well though I thought middle,False
likelyPig: has everyone voted?,False
youngPig: I don't think the mom was an asshole at all. What do you all think>,False
youngPig: ?,False
conventionalSquirrel: She was just advocating for herself when she was uncomfortable.,False
"youngPig: I think she brought it up in a kind way, without being mean",False
niceDonkey: I don't think she was an asshole. She maybe could have handled it better,False
littleOrangutan: I think she was wellmeaning and not the asshole at all,False
youngPig: Not an asshole? What is everyones vote?,False
"youngBison: I do not think the mom is an asshole either! I do think she could have asked them in a different way. Using the word ""disrespectful"" can trigger some people.",False
conventionalSquirrel: The word choice of it being disrespectful probably wasn’t the best.,False
spryHippo: I mdon't think the Mother is an asshole.  Different from the other scenerio because this one doesn't feel uncomfortable.  It says he speaks English just with an accent,False
littleRabbit: I feel more in the middle on this case. In a perfect world I guess she could've spoken to her son in private but overall she wasn't very rude,False
niceDonkey: She seemed abrasive to me but was within her right,False
"youngPig: Not an asshole, just using possibly triggering words",False
littleRabbit: I agree,False
spryHippo: He validated that he was the asshole when he went upstairs after she said something...rusde ,False
youngPig: Ture,False
littleOrangutan:  if the partner had the ability to speak english then he shoud have . the mom didnt have that option,False
youngPig: true,False
conventionalSquirrel: Not an asshole but definitely poor choice of words. More tact may have helped.,False
"niceDonkey: There is the fact that no matter what, at least she was direct, expressed her needs and opinion and tried",False
"niceDonkey: yeah. poor choice, agreed",False
niceDonkey: not an asshole,False
littleRabbit: There's a lot of worse ways to act in the situation,False
littleRabbit: I vote not,False
niceDonkey: Good point,False
niceDonkey: I vote not,False
"spryHippo: Her delivery could have been better, but his actions could have been too.  I feel like he made an effort to show zero respect.  He could have said, ""ok.""",False
conventionalSquirrel: He was able to speak English so this was really a poor choice on their part. ,False
spryHippo: I vote NOT too,False
littleOrangutan: if i was sitiing around people talking that i could not understand i would be uncomfortable,False
conventionalSquirrel: I vote not an asshole.,False
niceDonkey: The German guy could speak English as well,False
"spryHippo: He could, but he didn't well and expressed that it made him uncomfortable",False
"spryHippo: this guy didn't feel uncomfortable, but chose to make other uncomfortable",False
conventionalSquirrel: I definitely looked at both sides. She was right just tacky.,False
niceDonkey: good point,False
littleRabbit: and it was the son not the spouse that posted last time,False
littleOrangutan: I understand being uncomfortable with a new language but at least he had the ability to the mom didnt,False
"spryHippo: Looking at both side, they could have both done better, but the 20 year old should display some type of respect",False
"littleRabbit: yeah, you are a guest and need to take that into account",False
littleOrangutan: true,False
spryHippo: Focusing on this scenario...Mom isn't an asshole,False
littleRabbit: I think we can all agree not an asshole here then? Whenever the vote comes,False
conventionalSquirrel: I think the German husband should have given his husband a break. I know. Unrelated.,False
littleOrangutan: no not an asshole,False
conventionalSquirrel: Asshole delivery of a non asshole thing!,False
"spryHippo: Not an asshole, but not very tactful and could present better next time.",False
spryHippo: well said!,False
"littleOrangutan: Initially I thought the speaker (person 1) was an asshole, however by the end of the story as well as reading the edited text – I do not feel as if he was being an asshole. ",False
culturedMonkey: yes,True
smallWolf: My initial impression was he was an asshole. ,False
likelyGoat: I felt the same way as littleOrangutan but I still think he was an asshole,False
"littleOrangutan: He did have a good point – well, many good points. It would help her feel more independent if she even knew broken English vs relying on a family member.",False
culturedMonkey: my to,True
"likelyBison: I feel he is no that an asshole, however his feelings towards the situation kind were",False
"smallWolf: After reading his whole story, he still was the asshole.",False

culturedMonkey: yes he was,True
likelyGoat: It doesn't take much effort to help out his MIL why make such a big deal,False
littleHippo: I am sure he has a life too!,False
"likelyBison: Depending on how many times her MIL asked him for help, it can be difficult to cope with",False

littleHippo: Have you ever had to translate for someone? Think about all the people you talk to in a day.,False
"smallWolf: I have not, no.",False
likelyPanda:                      ,False
smallWolf: Unfortunately this is something he should have addressed before marrying into this family?,False

culturedMonkey: yes,True
"likelyGoat: yeah, but he said he only does it when she can't reach other family mmembers",False
"likelyBison: He has a fair point, however he cannot compared himself to his MIL",False
littleOrangutan: He is encouraging her to be more independent.,False
"littleOrangutan: He wasn't asking that she learned English to communicate with him, rather to assist herself and avoid panic while in social situations alone (without a translator).",False
"smallWolf: Depending on the age of his MIL, I'm sure it would be more difficult for her to learn a new language. ",False
likelyGoat: yes,False
"littleHippo: On the other hand, she should have thought about the language spoken 8 years ago before she moved here.",False
likelyGoat: or maybe she doens't understand all the inuendos and slang ,False
littleOrangutan: She's in a spanish speaking community though,False
smallWolf: How often is she having to go out without a family member though?,False
likelyBison: Sometimes moving into another country is a forced choice,False
"littleHippo: Yes, you are right.",False
"littleHippo: But, she has had 8 years to begin to learn the language. ",False
culturedMonkey: yes,True
likelyPanda:                          ,False

littleHippo: No,False
smallWolf: I say yes.,False
likelyBison: No.,False
littleOrangutan: My vote is no.,False
likelyPanda:       ,False
"likelyGoat: Yes, but like someone alrady said...she is much older and it is harder for older people to learn new languages. ",False
culturedMonkey: i say yes,True
littleHippo: He was being sincere in how he would help her learn English.,False
littleOrangutan: She could be 50 years old not 90,False
littleHippo: So,False
"likelyGoat: maybe he is being sincere, but he should still not cause a fuss and division in the family over something that probably doens't take up much time",False
"smallWolf: He's already helped this long with it, so why the breaking point now?",False
likelyPanda:                ,False
littleHippo: Maybe he has helped so long and he is tired. That happens after doing something for so long for somebody!,False
littleOrangutan: My comment was in response to likelyGoat about her age,False
"likelyGoat: first it will be this then it will be family dinners, and other traditions that his in-laws do",False
smallWolf: Agreed likelyGoat,False
"littleHippo: Since he clarified that he said it in a respectful tone, I say he is not an asshole.",False
culturedMonkey: yes,True
littleOrangutan: Agreed.,False
culturedMonkey: agreed,True
conventionalSquirrel: Now we get to see the other point of view,False
"littleLion: My initial impression is she was not the asshole, but at the end I believe she is.",False
conventionalSquirrel: and I think she is an asshole.,False
conventionalMonkey: Same!,False
littleLion: yes!,False
youngGoat: No,False
conventionalMonkey: She seems to be the asshole – she knows how much of a burden it can be to translate for her family since she's done it for years. She's putting a lot of pressure on her husband.,False
"littleLion: I understand she is busy with her Masters, but she needs to tell her Mom not to bypass her anymore.",False
"youngGoat: Yes, I am sorry she is an asshole!",False
conventionalSquirrel: You cannot expect from your husband to deal with something clearly do not want either.,False

conventionalMonkey: She even said that he's become the go-to for when her mother needs someone to translate.,False
youngGoat: Do we all agree? Yes!,False
littleLion: Yes youngGoat,False
conventionalMonkey: He was also venting and people jumped down his throat youn,False
conventionalMonkey: He was also venting and people jumped down his throat youngGiraffe,False
"littleLion: he was venting, but he married into that family.",False
youngGoat: He didn't learn Spanish to translate for future im-laws.,False
"conventionalSquirrel: His husband can have free time, but it does not mean he needs to invest all in her MIL",False
"littleLion: this is her family, so really it's her responsibility.",False
conventionalMonkey: I agree to all of the above.,False
youngGoat: niceHippo what is your opinion?,False
youngGoat: youngGiraffe,False
youngGiraffe: I really don't have a strong opinion on this one because it can go either way. ,False
youngGoat: littleLion ?,False
littleLion: I vote she is the asshole.,False
"conventionalSquirrel: It depends on how you see, and if you have experience something similar.",False
"conventionalSquirrel: I have experienced it, and it is not easy.",False
conventionalMonkey: conventionalSquirrel what are your thoughts then?,False
littleLion: I'm sure it's not. I'm not trying to downgrade this situation. It's just my thoughts/feelings.,False
"youngGoat: He may have overreacted this one time but, he can't be expected to do it all the time in the future. And, that is what she is suggesting.",False
conventionalMonkey: I totally agree youngGoat,False
"conventionalSquirrel: She should not be angry at him, she should help her husband too to deal with this situation",False
conventionalMonkey: Anyone have opposing opinions?,False
conventionalSquirrel: It is not a one person job.,False
"youngGoat: No, I think we all agreed she is an asshole!",False
conventionalSquirrel: Yes.,False
"conventionalMonkey: Awesome, glad we got to see the other side of the previous story!",False
littleLion: agreed!,False
youngGoat: Yes!,False
"youngGoat: On the other hand, you could say he knew when he married her that her parents didnt speak English and she was translating for them!!",False
"conventionalMonkey: True, I don't think he ever expected it to become his responsibility though. ",False
"youngGoat: She can not expect her husband to do what she has been doing. She has a point that her parents have worked hard to get here. And, that this country was made of immigrants.",False
likelyMonkey: Hi everyone. I considered the edit area a lot when considering that he is not the asshole. ,False
conventionalHorse: I think the guy is in the right asking his MIL to do for herself,False
conventionalHorse: Yes I did as well,False
"likelyMonkey: I feel like if he is offering to help her learn how to speak english so she can be independent is a good thing, as long as it was said with respect. ",False
conventionalLion: His post and his edit told very different stories. I went more with the original post because I felt like he could be editing to not seem like the bad guy.,False
conventionalHorse: That is true,False
"youngGiraffe: I surprised myself by deciding he was the asshole, not because he asked her politely, but because he apparently failed to take into consideration where they live: in an area with mostly people of Mexican and Latin American descent.",False
smallGorilla: it wasn't said with respect and that's what make him an asshole.,False
conventionalHorse: But he could have just been venting in the post and not said it disrespectfully to his MIL,False
"culturedCow: I do not consider that he is an asshole either, the reason for the discussion is something important and it is not at all selfish. I will only limit that his way of solving the situation if he was something idiotic. ",False
"conventionalLion: I don't think it's a bad idea to help her learn English, but he also can't make her do it.",False
conventionalHorse: He said it in respect,False
spryOrangutan: I am having trouble deciding one way or another. There is nothing wrong with trying to help someone by offering to help them with resources to learn a new language. ,False
likelyMonkey: The area at the bottom said that he did not speak to her that way as he did in the post. ,False
spryOrangutan: However telling someone you are being burdened by then instead of just saying you can't really help them as much anymore feels more like an asshole move. ,False
conventionalHorse: So he didn't read the whole thing...,False
smallGorilla: He meant well for his mother inlaw but he should be a little bit polite.,False
culturedCow: He could simply give her an app on her cell phone that translates everything she says into English,False
conventionalHorse: he didn't say that to her ,False
"youngGiraffe: Yeah, his edit took me from ""definitely the asshole"" to ""I still think he might be"" because of my reasons above.",False
conventionalHorse: he was just venting online,False
conventionalLion: I think his motives for helping her learn English are pretty selfish too.,False
"likelyMonkey: Also, considering he learned spanish to better be able to communicate with them, clearly he cares",False
"conventionalHorse: its not selfish, I wouldn't be able to spend ten minutes on the phone if I were at work ",False
culturedCow: I say that his motives are valid but the methods used were not.,False
"youngGiraffe: True, he has made the effort to communicate with this in-laws and MIL in a language that they are comfortable with.",False
"conventionalHorse: he was just venting online, and used different motives to explain it to her '",False
"likelyMonkey: Well that is why he put an edit section at the bottom, to clarify how he was not rude to her and offered help and resources",False
conventionalLion: He doesn't have to answer his phone. It's ok to set boundaries.,False
culturedCow: He cannot be her translator for life.,False
likelyMonkey: Absolutely agree,False
"smallGorilla: after considering both side, I have come to the conclusion that he is not an asshole because his motives are valid but he should be a little bit more polite.",False
"youngGiraffe: I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her.",False
conventionalHorse: if he didn't answer the phone he would catch hell from his wife,False
spryOrangutan: For him wanting her to stop relying on him as much is a perfectly valid reason but perhaps it was his focus on learning the language of the area that really made him come off as the asshole.,False
conventionalHorse: he did make that clear,False
"conventionalLion: I'm also curious as to why the entire family is mad at him if he was polite. I want to believe he was, but I'm having a hard time.",False
"youngGiraffe: I think if he had made it clear he offered to help her, for her convenience, and not made it sound like he was forcing independence from him on her, he would not be the asshole.",False
"conventionalLion: I think he was partly an asshole. I would love to believe otherwise, but I'm not convinced.",False
"conventionalHorse: this person is not an asshole, she has been here 8 years, it is time to learn the ""main"" language spoken in the country ",False
conventionalDonkey: I thin that he did his part in order to help out. He has a heart. He is not a complete asshole.,False
spryOrangutan: I think he was the asshole because people would always like to think they are polite but come off as anything but that.,False
"youngGiraffe: I think if he offered to teach his wife Spanish, that would be helpful. They could both serve as interpreters if needed. She should step up to the plate, also.",False
conventionalDonkey: A true asshole wouldnt do the things that he did,False
"littlePig: Hello, I consider that she is being selfish by supposing that he should do that duty as a husband as she did it as a family duty that she put on herself.",False
"littlePig: the husband only asks for consideration because it is no longer a spontaneous favor, it is a duty that is constantly placed on him.",False
likelyHorse: I think he is not selfish and is rightfully saying so,False
"littleMonkey: yeah, if she doesn't have time to help, why does her husband always have to drop everything to help?",False
likelyHorse: I wouldn't be able to do that if I were at work,False
conventionalGorilla: I would also consider the poster as the asshole as forcing the husband to do this without any consideration for his time is not cool.,False
youngGoat: `I agree. I feel she is being a jerk. She could of course shoot him a text and see if he has time to help at the very least.,False
"newRabbit: he is married to her so they her family, her parents are part of the family as well.",False
likelyHorse: Yes.  I think the wife is just pawning off the duties onto him,False
"youngGoat: You are not entitled to dictate the time of your family though, not even a spouse",False
"littlePig: I feel that she expresses her style ""I am productive and he is not, so he should do my family's duties in return""",False
conventionalGorilla: I get that the mother is also his family and there is a duty to help. But helping others kind of falls on the helper's time table. ,False
"littleMonkey: If the parents need help, they should also be considerate of other people and ask for help when someone is available, right?",False
likelyHorse: Men are not resources for throwing around,False
newRabbit: I think the husband should be able to accept the responsibility,False
youngGoat: I feel the biggest issue here is they are not being grateful and considerate but instead feel entitled because of the family card. There is a lack of respect for the husband. ,False
"likelyHorse: He can, but he was never asked the responsibility was forced on him",False
conventionalGorilla: The husband should help when able. But it is unreasonable to expect him to be able to do so at all hours. ,False
"littlePig: I consider that he can accept to do it, but as a favor it is not a duty that he must constantly fulfill.",False
"likelyHorse: I understand the wife's point of view, but she isn't that busy doing a masters",False
"newRabbit: not withstanding, the husband is still the asshole",False
"littlePig: I understand her too, but she is being very inconsiderate with her husband's feelings.",False
likelyHorse: Why didn't the wife teach them some English since they were here for years ,False
"likelyHorse: He isn't an asshole, I wouldn't do that either",False
littlePig: or buy a device that does translations of what she says.,False
"littleMonkey: An important part of marriage is helping each other, but it's also communicate needs. They both should be able to talk to each other and come up with a better solution to the problem than blaming each other. ",False
"likelyHorse: There was no compromise, just the expectation of him, doing it ",False
littleMonkey: communicating,False
littlePig: oh littleMonkey you are right there,False
littleMonkey: I agree. That's why I think she was in the wrong.,False
"newRabbit: the parents are not young, they are old. they might not even know how to read.",False
conventionalGorilla: It feels like the wife is trying to pass on what she feels are her responsibilities on the husband. ,False
"likelyHorse: She is wrong, and not compromising ",False
littlePig: yeah,False
snappyGiraffe: He's not an asshole.  He might be lacking in social grace's and politeness maybe even patience but his feelings are his own and he justified them.  ,False
niceGorilla: My initial expression was that he was an asshole. After completle reading it he does have it opinion on helping. A person is allowed to get frustrated. Maybe him not helping  would allow her to be less dependent and learn more english.,False
littlePig: I don't think this person is an asshole. It's not his responsibility to stand by and help his mother in law at random times of the day. it does not make him a racist. Definitely could have been a little more polite. ,False
"smallCow: I have mixed feelings about this scenario.  If he was really polite, I don't see a problem.  But his language and attitude bother me.",False
conventionalHippo: he mother in-law is disrupting his daily life and it was good that he was honest with her respectfully.,False
sprySquirrel: Learning a language is extremely hard for some people. Not everyone learns the same or at the same pace so him saying that to his MIL is inconsiderate. He's an asshole for thinking his feelings are ok but he was polite about the situation.,False
"conventionalHippo: The edit said that he did not use the words ""i'm sick of this shit"" and he said he tried to be polite",False
snappyGiraffe: His language and attitude were irksome but when he adjusted his original writing to reflect his views more accurately it didn't seem like an asshole to me.,False
spryOrangutan: I had mixed feelings about this scenario too. It would help if he or another family member would personally help her try to learn some parts of the language to help with every day tasks. She may not be comfortable going to ESL classes ,False
"littlePig: I agree, he should provide some more hands on assistance to help her learn instead of suggesting apps and classes.",False
"sprySquirrel: I think the way he went about it is okay since he was polite, but he needs to re-think about his mother in law's position.",False
snappyGiraffe: He offered to help from what I read.  He wants to help once instead of being relied upon forever.,False
conventionalHippo: That's true. And the fact that she has been in the US for 8 years may suggest that she tried to learn English but did not succeed.,False
"smallCow: So we agree that he was justified in what he felt, and he tried to be polite.  So was he an asshole?",False
conventionalHippo: I dont think he was an asshole,False
"littlePig: No, I do not think he was an asshole.",False
"smallCow: Okay, I'll say he was not an asshole.",False
sprySquirrel: I think he's an asshole for not being considerate ENOUGH. He should've thought about the whole situation from his mother in laws POV also before posting it online to strangers.,False
youngLion: I think he was an asshole.,False
conventionalHippo: what were some ways he could have been more considerate spr,False
conventionalHippo: sprySquirrel,False
youngLion: I think he absolutely is guilty of flaunting his white privedge.,False
sprySquirrel: Because some people can't learn another language as good as others because of many different factors.,False
smallCow: He should have tried to consider her feelings and situation a little better and tried to help more.,False
sprySquirrel: I'm bilingual so I see it from both point of views.,False
youngLion: I think the tone he used helped convince me of him being an asshole.,False
youngLion: I think his edits at the end are insincere and innacurate.,False
culturedRhino: My initial reaction is that she is not an asshole.,False
"spryHorse: I don't think she is the asshole. Her husband has gone through an education to learn the language, has more time on his hands, and has committed to her family ",False
"youngOrangutan: EVen though he seemed frustrated, he can take 10 minutes to help out. ",False
"niceHippo: I believe immigrants should learn the language of the country they go to.  And if he is getting all upset about doing it, she should not make him.",False
"snappyBear: She is not an asshole. I believe the husband is definitely more of an asshole than she is. He should be able to help out, it's his family too. ",False
"culturedRhino: He should share her values as her husband, and he should help her family when she is too busy.",False
spryHorse: I agree that they should try to learn the language but it is not as easy as it is made out to be even with those language learning resources,False
conventionalLion: She is not an asshole because she is completely right about this whole situation regarding the fact that her parents are immigrants and have worked really hard for her.,False
snappyBear: Definitely not easy to learn a language and especially at an older age. ,False
"culturedRhino: He had the privledge to learn the language in school when it is exponentially easier than as an adult. Now, he is unreasonably asking that they learn what he learned without the same resources.",False
conventionalLion: Learning languages is not easy specially at an older age. And when you are constantly working there is barely any time to practice a new language.,False
"niceHippo: They should speak English at home, instead of always going to Spanish.",False
"spryHorse: Maybe if she had more time on her hands and just didnt want to be responsible for translating so she dropped it on her husband, then she would seem more like an asshole. but this was not the case",False
snappyBear: You should always lend a helping hand to family when you are able to. ,False
culturedRhino: She is not the asshole for asking her husband to occasionally help her mother.,False
conventionalLion: The husband should be grateful that his wife's parents were even able to come to this country in the first place since they migrated.,False
"niceHippo: I still have mixed feelings about this.  But I'll concede, she is not trying to be an asshole.  ",False
conventionalLion: She's not an asshole.,False
"snappyBear: Not the asshole. Without her parents immigrating there, he wouldn't even have his wife. ",False
"likelyOrangutan: I don't feel he is an ass, nor do I think he is racist",False
"newWolf: I think what he said was fair, but I think he's the asshole for the way he communicated it.",False
youngDonkey: The person is not an asshole.,False
"newWolf: It seems like he could have brought it up in person, and not right as she asked for help.",False
smallPig: I think more than anything this is a generational/ cultural issue. My mother in law expects my husband and his siblings to just drop everything and do what she says ,False
youngDonkey: I dont think him as racist also.,False
culturedHippo: My first impression is that this guy is an asshole. It's clear that he's frustrated and then way he explains himself by the way he's complaining and venting about the situation,False
youngPanda: I agree with both of these points. I think he was coming from the right place and a desire to help. He was a little aggressive at the end of the post though.,False
smallPig: I don’t think he’s an asshole or racist ,False
"likelyOrangutan: He, if you read the edit, did not actually use harsh words, he was polite and if you go to a country to live you should actually learn the language",False
youngDonkey: Language is the problem in this context.Its his wish to make his mother-in-law to learn english.,False
likelyOrangutan: as well as the customes,False
youngPanda: Yeah I don't think he is racist at all,False
youngDonkey: I dont think any problem with that person.,False
likelyOrangutan: Not make but help her to learn it would help her to be more independent,False
"smallPig: I don’t think she would ever learn English, ",False
likelyOrangutan: She would if she had someone helping her along,False
youngDonkey: Its his own believes which made him to do so.,False
newWolf: One consideration I think is maybe her age - perhaps it's easier for him to learn than it will be for her. Though she could definitely try!,False
smallPig: I think her age is a huge part of this,False
"youngPanda: That is a good point, but I think even if it was clear she was trying to learn he probably would not have said anything",False
likelyOrangutan: thats true but considering my age I have learned enough Spanish to at least make what I am saying known,False
"culturedHippo: He may be doing and saying the right things to her, but his attitude about it seems a bit asshole-ish to me.",False
youngDonkey: Its difficult for her to learn english in this older age.But she might put an affort on this if she likes learning it.,False
smallPig: He offered to help her and gave her resources. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink,False
youngDonkey: I am telling both the sides.what i feel regarding the both sides.,False
likelyOrangutan: Just look at how others in the family would feel if she should the initiative the kids would be inspired by her,False
"newWolf: That's true, but there also isn't any indication that he has raised the point before.",False
youngPanda: So it seems like we are in agreement? Does anyone think he is the asshole?,False
"smallPig: When I say age is a factor, I mean mindset. Generational beliefs and customs ",False
newWolf: Or that he's tried to help her learn before,False
likelyOrangutan: Nope I do not,False
youngDonkey: I dont think he is an asshole,False
youngPanda: I do not either,False
smallPig: Nope,False
likelyOrangutan: so we all agree he is not an asshole,False
youngDonkey: ?He tried only to help her in learning english.,False
smallPig: Yes,False
youngDonkey: yes,False
youngPanda: ^,False
youngDonkey: person is not an asshole,False
"culturedHippo: I recognize the same attitude with myself. I internally judge someone, expect them to be like me. But to them he's being fake with how he really feels. How he really feels is how he's expressing it ""Dealing with her shit"". ",False
culturedHippo: That's how I internally talk to myself and judge others and I call that my inner asshole,False
likelyOrangutan: Seems he was trying to be helpful and loving and was very misjudged.  He is not an asshole.  ,False
"youngPanda: The person was trying to help his mother-in-law and was not being antagonistic. He may be an ""internal asshole"" but his actions are not outwardly reflecting that.",False
niceHorse: i dont think the person as an asshole,False
smallGoat: I understand she wants her husband to help out but it’s HER parents. If they have lived here that long they’ve should’ve learned enough English to get around. ,False
spryLion: I think they're both assholes. They both are shit attitudes and complain and bitch about it instead of communicating about how they really feel.,False
"culturedBison: My thought is that she is wrong for making her husband take the calls,  Sharing the responsibility is one thing But forcing the issue is another",False
"newRhino: I'm pretty torn on this one, but I lean towards her not being the asshole",False
smallGoat: She makes fun of her husbands Spanish but expects him to translate for her parents,False
newDonkey: I think both parties are kind of to blame here. I am leaning towards her being the asshole though because of the expectation he can always translate for her mother,False
culturedBison: Herparents could have learned some basic English from the beginning {like maybe when her and her siblings were in school},False
"newRhino: I don't think it's wrong to ask him for help, but it seems like they could work together to figure out a solution instead of an all or nothing",False
niceHorse: i understand that she just want his husband ti consider her mom as his own mom.,False
spryLion: She could definitely handle the situation a lot better than she is. And so could he.,False
spryLion: They should get counseling and do some personal development. ,False
smallGoat: Forcing him to talk the calls is ridiculous ,False
niceHorse: as he knows spanish shw wish that he can translate it to spanish,False
"culturedBison: Also why did she decided to be the one to tend the family, I mean her siblings should and most likely could step up also",False
smallGoat: Siblings could totally step up and help,False
newDonkey: I think that's a really important point ^^,False
niceHorse: ya siblings can help,False
culturedBison: I personally feel she is being an asshole,False
newDonkey: Can't they at least divide the responsibility among the husband and the siblings?,False
"spryLion: I live in a community where we practice owning up our shit. Instead of being victims in our lives and placing blame on others, to take responsibility. Aligning thoughts words and actions in one's life",False
smallGoat: culturedBison you make great points,False
culturedBison: or more to the point a dictator,False
culturedBison: Thanks Small smallGoat,False
culturedBison: how do you all vote?,False
newDonkey: I think he can definitely help but should not be expected to always be able to do so. I vote yes,False
smallGoat: I vote she’s the asshole,False
"newRhino: I think you made good points, but I think I still (Barely) lean towards no",False
niceHorse: i vote that she is an asshole,False
newRhino: I feel like there's too much responsibility on both sides,False
niceHorse: equal responsibilty for both sides,False
culturedBison: new newRhino what is the basis' for the lean? ,False
culturedBison: The parents needed to take on some responsibility the spouse should want to help but the wife should not dictate to him ,False
"newRhino: I think they both have responsibility for how this turned out, and it seems like neither of them are communicating",False
culturedBison: That maybe true but I only say what she was saying he did not type up anything it was just her view,False
"newRhino: I don't disagree that the parent(s) should learn, but I don't think that should factor into the discussion about the wife/husband responsibility as much",False
newDonkey: I think she is but I respect that perspective,False
culturedBison: I think she is also,False
newRhino: That's true too! Hearing only one side is not great,False
niceHorse: person is an asshole.we cannot force our parents to learn a particular language,False
smallGoat: I don’t do things just because my husband tells me to....,False
niceHorse: its difficult to learn language in older age,False
conventionalGiraffe: My initial thought is that the daughter is not wrong. ,False
newHippo: i am with you,False
youngPanda: I don't think she is wrong either,False
conventionalGiraffe: Her husband should be able to help out since it's his in-laws and it is helping his wife out by helping them.,False
newLion: I can understand where the husband is coming from. ,False
snappyBison: I'm not sure ,False
newHippo: At the most if the husband is busy he can simply ask mom to call back in an hour,False
newLion: It's no longer a favor but an expectation. ,False
snappyBison: I can see both sides,False
"conventionalDonkey: I totally get why the husband would be upset because he probably feels like he is taking on all of that responsibility of  translating. But he also married her, and it is his family too as she said. ",False
youngPanda: I'm with you newHi,False
snappyHorse: A nation of immigrants doesn't mean a nation where you can go your whole life without learning the language of the other 85%. ,False
conventionalDonkey: He also isn't doing anything so why can't he just help them for a couple minutes.,False
youngPanda: newHippo I agree,False
"littleRabbit: While I understand the husband's annoyance, I don't think she is wrong.",False
snappyBison: They should learn the language,False
"likelyGoat: I can slightly see both sides as well. If the calls are excessive, I can see why the husband is getting frustrated",False
newHippo: Exactly he has time,False
conventionalGiraffe: It would put more stress on her to have to deal with it - so he's helping his wife more on this,False
"snappyHorse: Plus, we don't know how long they've been in the US. Anything more than like four years is too long to not know passing English, even just reading.",False
newHippo: You are helping your wife and her parents deal with it for a while ,False
"conventionalDonkey: I can see if they are excessive, but I mean it doesn't seem like it was by the article, and also it is his family. I help my family when they need help no matter what time it is.",False
snappyBison: They should learn the language but the husband should help them,False
likelyGoat: I think the husband was a bit snappy. he should have more sympathy and understanding since he is part of the family now. and has been throughout the years,False
"conventionalGiraffe: and even though it should be the official language of the US, it's not yet",False
"snappyHorse: But the husband shouldn't have to, that's why he's not the asshole. I will help my in-laws, but not everyday forever just because that's the way they do it.",False
newLion: I do think there are a lot of resources to learn english.,False
"conventionalDonkey: I also don't like that he threw in they should learn english by using other means, I felt that was rude and unnecessary. ",False
"littleRabbit: Even if it would be nice for them to learn English, they're not obligated to, even if it's easy.",False
"snappyHorse: Like, for instance, the very things they're trying to make him translate.",False
"conventionalGiraffe: My husband knows more about computers than I do so when my parents need help, he helps - seems basic",False
newHippo: This is the way he needs to help support his wife at the moment. Do it. They are not asking him to go to war. 10 minutes to translate somehing ,False
"snappyHorse: We have the same letters, just learn them.",False
"newLion: I think if his approach had been different, the wife may have not been so snappy.",False
conventionalDonkey: I help my in laws no matter when they need help. They're my family too.,False
"youngPanda: I dont think the husband should HAVE to but, yeah its not too much to ask",False
likelyGoat: I feel that they should all sit down together and discuss this situation openly and honestly. ,False
"newLion: I think he hit a nerve, insinuating that they had the resources to drop everything to learn English.",False
littleRabbit: And the fact is that he chose to marry into the family.,False
"conventionalGiraffe: yeah, he did hit a nerve....",False
conventionalGiraffe: i agree likelyGoat that they should talk this through as a group,False
conventionalGiraffe: maybe they can come to a compromise,False
"likelyGoat: The wife should not expect her husband to do to certain things that he may not want to do, however, he should be more tactful about saying no. ",False
"snappyBison: The husband should help his inlaws, but they should try to help by learning the language.",False
"conventionalDonkey: I agree they should have an open conversation about times that he is able to help, and about how to help so that it's not excessive. ",False
littleRabbit: A compromise would definitely  lead to the best result.,False
newHippo: when you are maried you are going to have to make sacrafices no matter what ,False
newHippo: this is a very small one,False
newLion: I doubt the inlaws realize that they may be asking too much from him.,False
"snappyHorse: I don't know, it seems like a cultural thing. ",False
conventionalGiraffe: yep..... so she's not an asshole,False
conventionalGiraffe: he's not necessarily either but i think the question is focused on her,False
"newLion: I agree, neither is an ahole. ",False
conventionalDonkey: No she is not the asshole.,False
snappyBison: She isn't a ahole,False
likelyGoat: He should have known what he was getting himself into when they got married. I am sure he was helping them during the courtship phase. ,False
youngPanda: They really should talk it out. neither is the A here,False
snappyHorse: I would disagree. I think she's more the asshole because she thinks he's privileged by wanting her old parents to learn the language of the country they're in. ,False
"littleRabbit: Even though she could have dealt with the situation differently, she's not TA.",False
likelyGoat: I completely agree with the comment above. ,False
"conventionalDonkey: It is my opinion that she is not an asshole. I think she is just trying to help her family, and he is part of her family now. I think there needs to be a discussion of how to make it work better, but she still is not the asshole.",False
likelyGoat: He is clearly the asshole,False
smallRhino: My initial impression is that he is the asshole. ,False
"newPanda: Still not the asshole. They've been in the US eight years, that's ample time to learn at least how to read.",False
"smallBison: Initially, I don't think he's a jerk. I did at first but then he explained himself",False
"snappyCow: I think the son-in law is being reasonable, but his tone makes him sound like an asshole.",False
conventionalGorilla: I´m on the other end,False
smallBison: he did seem jerky at first but then explained it in his EDIT,False
smallRhino: I agree his tone does make him seem like an asshole.,False
"newPanda: Yeah, but you're allowed to swear on the internet. All he did was show his irritation on a reddit post.",False
littleWolf: I can see where he is coming from now.,False
smallRhino: I totally understand that they have been here 8 years and get they probably should be able to learn it by now.,False
"snappyCow: He did give her resources, and he's trying to help her to learn.",False
newPanda: Eight whole years that they've failed to pick up anything at all.,False
"snappyCow: At the same time, maybe that's very difficult for her.",False
"niceGoat: If he's telling the truth that when speaking to them he was polite, that changes things.",False
niceDonkey: no i don't think the guy is the ahole. The parents need to learn to speak the language. But until they do he needs to help the best he can,False
conventionalGorilla: he comes off as a little rude but not an asshole in terms of his actions,False
"newPanda: I would be annoyed as hell too, he seems like a good guy.",False
"snappyCow: Regardless, there's a breakdown and all parties need to talk and set expectations.",False
"smallRhino: But I also don't really think he handled it right, and maybe should have went with all the family together in order to speak with them about learning english.",False
niceDonkey: The parents need to make an effort here,False
"snappyCow: He does come off as an ahole in comparing himself to her, in terms of his ability to learn all these other languages. ",False
newPanda: But now this guy is getting it from all sides that he shouldn't expect any work from his in-laws,False
littleWolf: but at the same time just because something is easy for you to do doesn't mean it is easy for someone else.,False
conventionalGorilla: If he´s willing to devote time and effort to helping her learn and she´s just unwilling... I can´t call him an asshole,False
"smallBison: Yeah, i think talking it through with his wife first would have been helpful too",False
smallBison: before he talked to the MIL,False
niceGoat: I definitely agree that he could have handled the situation better.,False
"newPanda: I mean yeah, talking with your wife is a good first step but he's a reasonable guy.",False
littleWolf: smallRhino Thats true,False
"niceDonkey: He should speak to them in english, to help them learn",False
"smallRhino: I think comparing his ability to learn and hers was rude. She may have learning issues, or who knows what that makes it more difficult for her.",False
newPanda: Just because something is more difficult for someone else doesn't mean they shouldn't still be expected to do it. ,False
conventionalGorilla: niceDonkey according to him he´s offered to help and passed along apps and information,False
niceDonkey: The whole family should help them learn to speak English,False
smallBison: yeah comparing how quickly he learns languages isn't fair,False
smallBison: i don't think i could do it so easily,False
newPanda: after eight years it really just seems like they're lazy with regards to learning english.,False
"snappyCow: I agree, all hands on deck instead of it being about only the husband. ",False
littleWolf: he was pretty rude to assume that because he learned 2 languages that she can do it too,False
newPanda: but after eight years you'd be able to do something right?,False
"snappyCow: Maybe, they are not used to learning as easily as he is.",False
"smallRhino: I do think it's good he's offering to help. I think just the initial approach was a little rude, but his edit did make it a little better.",False
newPanda: They aren't used to learning?,False
"niceGoat: Regardless of the specific English issue, I don't think it's too much to ask of him to help out once in a while.",False
"newPanda: They're humans. They can do it, they just aren't.",False
littleWolf: Yeah I like that he offered to help,False
"snappyCow: What I mean is, in their country, maybe they don't have access to the learning resources that we have in America.",False
"smallBison: so yeah...i think as of now, not an ahole",False
niceGoat: I guess it really depends how time-consuming this is for him.,False
newPanda: In their country? they're in the US now.,False
newPanda: If they can't figure out duolingo that he provided that's on them.,False
"smallRhino: I agree niceGoat How often is this happening, and is it excessive.",False
littleWolf: He didn't just say go learn English. he said here are some tools and I can help.,False
"snappyCow: I know, but their foundation was formed in the country they were born in.",False
littleWolf: Not the Ahole,False
smallBison: yes i a gree snappyCow,False
niceDonkey: not an ahole,False
"smallRhino: I am starting to think he's not really an asshole. Do I agree completely no, but think he really is just trying to help them",False
"newPanda: Oh my lord. If I moved to Japan what is the expectation there? You have to adapt, especially after eight years. Inexcusable. ",False
conventionalGorilla: slightly rude maybe but not an asshole,False
"smallRhino: I don't think he's an asshole in the end. I think he is trying to help, but maybe just could've approached it better. ",False
"niceGoat: In the context of this sub, the way he went about it qualifies him as TA.",False
littleWolf: Yep I think he was just getting tired of having to translate in the middle of his day and found a solution to help everyone.,False
niceSquirrel: hi,False
newRhino: Hey!,False
"conventionalLion: Since it is the mother's house, she can ask the guests to behave in a way that makes her comfortable",False
likelyCow: I think this person is not an asshole because if they are all sitting in the same room as a family they should communicate in the same language with each other.,False
likelyCow: I think this person has the right to know what is being discussed in her own home,False
niceSquirrel: I think that the son and his partner were being very inconsiderate,False
"conventionalLion: If the guests cannot conform to her requests, they should consider staying in another location",False
newRhino: I agree however I think the person could have said it in a better manner,False
smallMonkey: I think the son and his mate are the assholes. It is really rude to not include everyone in conversations.,False
likelyCow: I agree! The son's partner was an asshole by immediately going upstairs instead of analyszing the situation.,False
niceSquirrel: They were staying at her house. And it's not like they can't speak English.,False
conventionalLion: It was difficult to tell from the passage if the mother likes/approves of her son's partner.,False
likelyCow: It is possible that they were not saying anything rude. But they should have at least made her feel included.,False
smallMonkey: Well she probably likes him less because of his behavior.,False
conventionalLion: i think it was a small enough request that the son and his partner can accommodate the mother with little effort.  I think the son was making it into a bigger deal than it was,False
likelyCow: newRhino did you think the person was an asshole?,False
"newRhino: Yes, I agree that this person was the asshole",False
smallMonkey: Do we all agree that the son is the asshole.,False
"niceSquirrel: The prompt says that she told them in a ""nice manner"".",False
likelyCow: seems like we all agree.,False
conventionalLion: I would agree that the mother is not an asshole.  I'm not sure if we are to determine whether the son is.,False
likelyCow: oh i read that wrong,False
likelyCow: I agree that she is not an asshole,False
"niceSquirrel: The mother is definitely not an asshole, in my opinion.",False
newRhino: I typed that wrong. I agree with everyone,False
newRhino: the mother was not an asshole,False
conventionalLion: it seems like we all agree,False
likelyCow: lol,False
likelyCow: do we have to say that we all agree or anything like that?,False
likelyHorse: i agree,False
likelyCow: or do we just wait for the next page,False
conventionalLion: The mother is not an asshole because it is her house and she was being made uncomfortable.  She asked in a kindly manner for the son and his partner to speak English.  This is not an unreasonble request.,False
"niceSquirrel: Ok, so I guess we all decided that she's not an asshole.",False
smallMonkey: The mother is not the asshole the son is however he needs to grow up and be more sensitive to his mother.,False
likelyDonkey: Hello.,False
spryGiraffe: Hi,False
newWolf: Hi,False
likelyDonkey: I personally think this person is an asshole for not involving everyone in the conversation.,False
newPig: i think this guy is being compleatly disrespectful of the fact that he is at his mothers house,False
newWolf: I feel like she is the asshole because its her mothers house,False
newPig: totaly agree,False

newWolf: exactly,False
newPig: yes ,False
likelyDonkey: Yeah I agree. She should have a talk with her husband so that they can find a solution in which everyone is comfortable. ,False
newPig: it seems we are all on the same page here,False
newWolf: Its not polite to leave someone out of the conversation,False
spryBear: I think the son is an asshole.  He should comply with his mother's requests as long as they are reasonable since he is staying at her house.  This seems to be a reasonable request.,False
likelyDonkey: She is seeing her mother after a long time as well so it is rude if she will be at her house but not communicating properly.,False
likelyDonkey: So seems like our verdict is that this person is an asshole.,False
newPig: yeah it would seem resonalable to limit the german only ttalking to when they were alone,False
spryGiraffe: They can speak German when it's just them two in private. But they should at least make an effort to speak English when the mother is around.,False
"spryBear: I agree with likelyDonkey  he hasn't seen his mother in a long time, he should be worried about communicating with her not his husband",False
likelyDonkey: Yes I am sure the mother feels very uncomfortable now.,False
likelyDonkey: Great.,False
spryGiraffe: I don't see how it can be so uncomfortable for the husband to speak English with the family. It's not like he's giving a speech to a crowd.,False
likelyDonkey: I think he gets embarrassed when he says something wrong,False
spryBear: agreed.  i'm sure the mother would be undertanding that he doesn't speak English very well,False
spryBear: and it also sounds like the mother was nice when she requested it...not mean,False
newWolf: Yep she sounds like she just wants to spend time with them,False
newPig: yeah so why did he even go to his mothers if he only cares for his husband,False
likelyDonkey: That is so true.,False
likelyDonkey: I am concluding that this person is an asshole for the way the situation was handled.,False
spryGiraffe: I am voting that he is an asshole.,False
newWolf: I agree,False
newOrangutan: I'm sort of on the fence on this one.,False
youngRabbit: He should want to help his family.,False
culturedMonkey: Me too,False
newOrangutan: I can see both sides,False
snappyPig: One initial thought that came to mind is how difficult English is for non-native speakers. ,False
niceHippo: Agreed. I could see reasons for both sides.,False
youngRabbit: They don't want to be a burden. ,False
newBear: It's not that hard to help her mother out herself.,False
culturedMonkey: I think the person should also consider that if it's no big deal for her husband to dedicate the time then she should also do it.,False
culturedGorilla:      ,False
niceHippo: The narrator seemed a bit selfish to assume the husband could handle the role each time.,False
newOrangutan: They make fun of the gringo and then rely on his translation skills,False
"newBear: The husband shouldn't have to be responsible to translate just so ""he can practice""  ",False
"snappyPig: Well. She is also in school but that will last maybe 2 years, so the guy has to help for a couple of years only... ",False
niceHippo: True. But then the husband's point of view did seem a bit rude.,False
"culturedMonkey: However, the husband was also being inconsiderate when he said that they should just learn English.",False
newOrangutan: He took the intiative to learn Spanish so i can see his point,False
newBear: The husband could be more willing to help.,False
youngRabbit: I think the husband is a jerk.,False
culturedGorilla:          ,False
"newBear: It should't be expected for him to help, they're both busy",False
"culturedMonkey: So far, I think the husband was rude.",False
youngRabbit: Why did he even learn spanish,False
"niceHippo: I think the husband is rude, but I guess it was also a bit rude for the narrator to assume he should be obligated to help",False
newBear: I think the wife puts unfair responsibilities on her husband,False
culturedGorilla:     ,False
snappyPig: Like I get that it can be a bit irritating to always have to help with this or that but he could still approach it otherwise. Like use his time with them to also teach them.,False
culturedMonkey: I agree ,False
newOrangutan: That's a good idea,False
newBear: Yes but it shouldn't be an expectation,False
youngRabbit: All she is asking is that he help to translate every once in a while.,False
culturedMonkey: He kind of just left them to their own devices by saying that they should learn English.,False
niceHippo: I think the prompt was vague though in if she was asking him to do it or basically requiring him to help them,False
newBear: it makes it sound as though its his job now,False
"snappyPig: Even if they were to learn English, they would learn it overnight. In the mean whiles he still has to help them.",False
culturedMonkey: I think he just assumed the role when the mom started calling him directly.,False
newOrangutan: I don't think he should just be expected to translate. it would be nice if he was at least given a choice,False
culturedMonkey: That's true. ,False
snappyPig: I think the wife also needs to consider that constantly helping them with English may also not be helping the parents either. What if he gets sick?,False
culturedGorilla:                  ,False
newBear: I think they both could approach this differently. ,False
culturedMonkey: I think they should have talked about it more. ,False
"snappyPig: In the end, its tough but I will err on the side of the wife. I think that we are not asking the hubs to do this in the long haul. Just for a short whiles.",False
littleRabbit: My initial impression is that he is being rude.,False
snappyGorilla: The husband is way out of line,False
littleDonkey:  ,False
niceHorse: This guy obviously has a gift for languages. It's his right to use that gift any way he chooses.,False
"spryHippo: Agreed. I can see why he must be frustrated, but that's not the way to respond",False
littleDonkey:      ,False
littleRabbit: He should have approached the situation differently. ,False
"snappyLion: I did not like his tone throughout most of it. I wondered that if his tone is like this that easily, then what was he really like with the mom?",False
"niceHorse: If anything, the family is being rcist",False
snappyGorilla: He did give her a lot of tools to use to help her learn English though,False
littleRabbit: Just because it is easy for him doesn't mean it is easy for the family.,False
"spryHippo: He did, but that doesnt mean the parents can access those tools like he can",False
snappyGorilla: He could have confided in his wife to let her know that it's bothering him and see how he should approach it in a positive way,False
"snappyLion: English is a lot harder than many other languages. If you are born in it, it is hard to see that. Its not that easy to pick up.",False
littleRabbit: He also made it to be like they are not trying when he doesn't know their situation.,False
littleDonkey:       ,False
youngSquirrel: The way she speaks to people is disrespectful. ,False
littleRabbit: He is disrespectful. ,False
niceHorse: i think they are relying on him too much.',False
spryHippo: He is voicing frustration but it does not seem like he is trying to think about the family's perspective on why it might be hard for them,False
"snappyGorilla: He really should have been respectful to her and helped her out, does it really take that much time out of his schedule?",False
"snappyLion: I think he does have a point, but the way he seemed to be going about it ...",False
snappyGorilla: He is frustrated and should be able to talk to his family,False
spryHippo: I think he could have instead offered to help her instead of just giving her resources to basically help herself,False
littleRabbit: He does have a point but he let his frustration get in the way. Even his family doesn't agree with him from my understanding. ,False
youngSquirrel: he is rude.,False
spryHippo: agreed,False
"snappyGorilla: His family has a right to be upset, he was really rude",False
littleDonkey: ,False
"snappyLion: You can be respectful and still gently suggest Mango, ESL or something like that. ",False
niceHorse: I'm getting the impression that there are other issues here as well,False
littleRabbit: I agree. There is something else.,False
snappyLion: Like how often he has to keep answering them?,False
youngSquirrel: i agree,False
spryHippo: good point,False
snappyGorilla: They probably have a opinion about him anyway from before this.  ,False
spryHippo: maybe he feels the family is taking advantage of him,False
niceHorse: Maybe he resents being the token gringo,False
snappyGorilla: But i'm sure that he has said other questionable things.,False
spryHippo: yeah especially since he edited the post trying to clarify what he actually said to them,False
"snappyLion: So if there are other issues behind the scenes, the language issue might just be ... hmm ... something on the surface.",False
niceHorse: right,False
spryHippo: good point,False
littleDonkey:             ,False
"snappyGorilla: I don't think he needs to lash out at the mother in law, he could have done it in a appropriate way that was effective for everyone.  ",False
littleRabbit: I think he is being rude. He came off like that to everyone. It is hard to imagine he did it differently with the tone he is using in the post.,False
"spryHippo: I think just from what we know, I would lean on saying yes to the verdict ",False
littleDonkey:  ,False
"snappyLion: In this one also, I think in the end, I err on the side of the family. Sometimes even if you have a valid point, you have to put up with things in a family. For the peace of everyone.",False
conventionalLion: initial thoughts ass or not?,False
smallHippo: I said he's the asshole for how he handled it.,False
conventionalBear: Id say not,False
"likelyBison: He should be nicer to his mother in law and help her, or at the very least, talk more kindly.  Ass",False
smallCow: Initial thought no,False
niceGiraffe: I said not.,False
conventionalLion: i say not,False
spryOrangutan: I say not,False
conventionalBear: 8 years in the country its probably time,False
niceGiraffe: He said he was respectful and I believe it was a reasonable request.,False
"likelyBison: I agree, but older people can't learn as quickly as he might have been able to",False
"smallCow: He signed up to be a husband, not a translator crutch to his whole family. Undue burden on him, he's not the asshole.",False
"conventionalLion: There are safety concerns also. If she had a medical issue while out, how would she be able to convey that",False
"snappyGoat: This is a tough one. I'm leaning toward ""not the asshole."" He hasn't refused to help his MIL. He's frustrated at being called on to translate without warning.",False
niceGiraffe: Things should be taken into account though.  Is it hard for her to learn languages?  Is she dyslexic or have a learning disability?,False
"conventionalBear: While she may not learn as fast as he claimed to, the classes take all ages in regards and Im sure would help her",False
niceGiraffe: It gets harder to learn as you get older.,False
"likelyBison: I still think ass by how he handled it, I wouldn't want my husband talking to my mom like that.",False
snappyGoat: He's trying to provide her the resources that would make it easier for her to learn conversational English.,False
"conventionalLion: @Bison, his edit stated that he was respectful to the MIL",False
"likelyBison: He is, but he could continue to help while she learned.",False
"smallHippo: I agree she should learn english, but the MIL sees him as part of the family and trusts him, he handled it poorly instead of asking the wife to help her understand his frustration",False
snappyGoat: I don't think he's expecting her to become fluent. He's trying to get her to the point where she can handle day-to-day transactions without needing a translator.,False
"smallCow: The fault is that she EXPECTS him to be the translator. If she treated it as a privilege and was appreciative, different story. Instead she is treating it as an expectation. Not fair to him!",False
"likelyBison: Respectly how he stated it, didnt sound respectful to me",False
smallCow: It said he stated it politely and respectfully,False
"snappyGoat: I understand, too, how the family could see his behavior as disrespectful or callous.",False
likelyBison: He married into it and should respect elders,False
"snappyGoat: You can respect elders while still saying ""enough is enough.""",False
"conventionalLion: I agree, enough is enough",False
smallCow: likelyBison he should do whatever they say because they're elders? ,False
"snappyGoat: ""Respect"" <> ""When I say 'jump,' you say 'how high'""",False
likelyBison: I feel bad for her though.  She looks up to him and trusts him,False
smallCow: I agree with that likelyBison,False
"snappyGoat: Perhaps the entire family needs to sit down and discuss who will be available, and under what circumstances, to translate.",False
conventionalLion: All he wants is for the MIL to be independent. That is not a bad thing,False
likelyBison: but he can still help when she needs help,False
"smallCow: I feel bad for her, but she obviously lacks self awareness if she does't see how her lack of effort is affecting the lives of someone she cares about",False
"smallCow: and yes, he should still help her if needed",False
smallCow: this isn't cold turkey. we just need steps in the right direction,False
snappyGoat: And also to discuss what's reasonable for MIL. Could she get comfortable speaking enough English to go to the grocery store? The doctor's office? A government office?,False
likelyBison: shouldn't we love one another though even though she may have a fault,False
smallCow: no,False
"conventionalBear: all in all he is trying to help, not an ass",False
spryOrangutan: agreed,False
snappyGoat: I don't think the OP is the asshole. He's not refusing to help and he's not mocking his MIL. He is asking her to take steps to become more independent.,False
likelyBison: I still think ass,False
conventionalLion: Not an asshole,False
smallCow: he is trying to help,False
niceGiraffe: Not an ass,False
smallCow: and why does the grandma even wanna be incompetent,False
"likelyBison: Good points, still think he could handle it differntly",False
niceMonkey: She is an ass,False
culturedWolf: I think she's the asshole,False
conventionalHorse: she is an ass,False
culturedSquirrel: She's the asshole for making him translate,False
niceHippo: yes,False
newDonkey: I don't think she is an ass,False
niceMonkey: She talks about MAKING her husband translate,False
"niceHippo: If she is so busy and can't do it herself, she shoudln't expect him too",False
culturedBison: I think she's leaving out information that might make her not the asshole. How often does mom call the husband for help?,False
"littleLion: I think she is,   why not disperse the work load over the rest of the english speaking family members and appoint him as the go to ",False
conventionalHorse: yeah she is blind to the consequences of the demands she is making on a daily basis on someone she is supposed to care for,False
culturedBison: Did OP talk to the husband about his availability before she started sending all translation requests to him?,False
"niceMonkey: She is mad because her husband won't tke 10 minutes out of his day, What about her?",False
"niceHippo: but she makes him do it because she is too busy, so clearly she doesn't even want to do it herself",False
"culturedBison: How disruptive are these translation requests? Is it really ""10 minutes once in a while?""",False
culturedSquirrel: she literally says she's making him do it,False
niceMonkey: She talks about it being the respectful thing to do. That goes for her too,False
"culturedWolf: I think shes the asshole for just thinking her husband will do this anytime, it's not his obligation",False
"culturedBison: With ONLY the information available, I think she's TA.",False
newDonkey: I think the argument can be made either way since it isn't much time out of their day.,False
"littleLion: yup agreed, she is TA",False
conventionalHorse: literally the grandma is making other people labor because she is too lazy or unwilling to learn English and the wife is enabling that behavior,False
"niceHippo: it is not his obligation, if he didn't mind, it would be a different story.  But I am sure he has his own things to do as well",False
niceMonkey:  she has done is pass the buck to her husband,False
niceMonkey: She is not respectful or trying for the family,False
"culturedWolf: She's also not considerate to her mother, she should help her learn english so life is easier.",False
"culturedBison: It also sounds like there are other people in the family who could help with translation. ""Respect"" doesn't mean ""do anything I ask without question.""",False
"niceHippo: if he is bothered by it, he should not be forced to do it",False
"conventionalHorse: newDonkey it could be 5 minutes out of his day or an hour, but its the principle of dumping your load on someone else because you dont wanna deal with it that is the issue. Now he can help her along way of learning English, but no crutch",False
littleLion: I agree with culturedBison,False
niceMonkey: It would be a different story if the wife was helping equally,False
niceHippo: me too,False
"culturedBison: So I'm coming down on the side of ""the OP is TA."" She didn't ask her husband before delegating the responsibility to him. She made the decision unilaterally.",False
conventionalHorse: yes,False
"culturedWolf: do we have consensus, does anyone think she is NTA",False
conventionalHorse: NTA,False
conventionalHorse: wait,False
conventionalHorse: my b,False
conventionalHorse: she is.,False
niceHippo: I think asshole,False
conventionalHorse: ^,False
"culturedSquirrel: she's definitely TA, no reason to force him to translate",False
"niceMonkey: make sure to expand, vote and submit",False
"niceHippo: yep, if she wants to, thats fine, but shouldn't force anyone else to",False
niceMonkey: She is an asshole,False
culturedBison: She's the asshole because she assigned this responsibility to him without consulting.,False
niceMonkey: Expand and vote,False
"conventionalLion: This one is tough but I think that overall, the mother ITA.",False
smallGiraffe: I agree,False
littleCow: I disagree and think that the mother is not the asshole. I think this because it really isn't fair that her son and his partner were talking in front of her in a language she doesn't understand.,False
conventionalLion: The French guy should definitely make more of an effort to use English but asking him not to use his mother tongue is unreasonable.,False
"likelyOrangutan: The parent is the asshole here, the kids husband learned English to participate in the converstaion, they can learn French if they want to participate ",False
"niceBison: I agree. I think the mother should respect that the sons partner only speaks French. If she was really about the situation, she would kindly ask to learn the language as well. ",False
likelyOrangutan: He may not feel comfortable talking in English,False
"conventionalLion: Most couples have a ""secret language"" but this one just happens to be an actual other language. ",False
littleCow: I don't know. I think it's a bit rude to talk in a different language when you know someone in the room can't. Shouldn't they involve her in the conversation if she's there?,False
"conventionalLion: That is a good point, likelyOrangutan",False
littleCow: And keep their private conversations to themselves if they want to talk about something.,False
"smallHorse: I think that the asshole  is equally divided between the two actually.  The mother should have said something discreetly to her son alone, not made a scene. But the son should have known better than to exclude his mother, and leave her out.",False
smallGiraffe: I think that the mother of those kids should let her kids go to disney world with her ex. I dont think she is being honest about her reasons for saying no .,False
niceBison: That is a good point though. Yeah they should keep their conversations private and let the mom in on their conversations in public...you're right,False
"conventionalLion: That might have been the case, littleCow  It could have been a private thing.",False
littleCow: I can see that smallHorse,False
likelyOrangutan: So he sould ask everyone around him if they speak his language before talking? That sounds likea  great way to give him more axiety,False
niceBison: I can see that conventionalLion,False
littleCow: I'm not saying that at all likelyOrangutan I just think it's rude that they'd have a conversation in front of one other person when they know they can't understand.,False
"likelyOrangutan: If he is talking to you he'll speak in a language you can understand, if not then its none of your business what hes saying",False
littleCow: If someone did that to me I'd feel like the people were talking badly about me and that's not a fair situation. ,False
"smallHorse: If I had to pick one though, I guess I would say mom is the bigger asshole.  She should not have made a scene and embarrassed them both.",False
likelyOrangutan: If you want to know learn the language,False
"conventionalLion: I pretty much agree, smallHorse  there is some blame on both sides but I would give more to the mother for making a scene about it.",False
likelyOrangutan: Don't be paranoid,False
likelyOrangutan: The world doesnt revolve around you,False
niceBison: I do consider both sides of the agrument because maybe the son and his partner were having a private conservation and then the partner felt uncomfortable. So that's why he went upstairs to save the rest of the conservation for later.,False
newSquirrel: I think it is just easier for the husband to continue speaking French and may not know how to express what he wants to say in English.,False
smallGiraffe: I think the son and his friends should speak in a language that his mother understands when she is around. He should try to make her feel more comfortable when she is around.,False
littleCow: They should especially make her feel comfortable seeing as they were in her house.,False
smallHorse: good point littleCow ,False
"likelyOrangutan: And if they are talking about you who give a fuck if they say it in another language in front of you, or in your language behind your back either way you're not going to know",False
"conventionalLion: A good point, newSquirrel,  we don't know his level of proficiency.",False
niceBison: The husband should continue speaking in the language he is comfortable with. With also respecting the mother in the process since it is her house. ,False
niceBison: Good point,False
conventionalLion: I am still leaning towards the mother but there is blame for everyone here.,False
"likelyOrangutan: Demanding that someone speak your language when the converstaion doesn't involve you is pure narcissim, demanding you be included even when not needed",False
littleCow: I honestly believe the mother wasn't trying to be offensive. I think she just wanted to be included. Maybe she wants to build a better relationship with the partner. I don't think she's the asshole.,False
"culturedPig: As in the first one, I do not believe that this person is the asshole.",False
likelyGorilla: My initial impression here is that the son is the asshole because he knows his mother can't speak German and they're in her house.,False
culturedPig: But I think it's a very close thing and steps should be taken by both sides.,False
"niceLion: NO he's not an asshole, but he should include his mother more and make an effort to help his husband speak better english",False
"conventionalPanda: The son is the asshole. He stated he made a choice to basically exclude his mother. He should have compromised.  Spoke English some, German some. Instead, he's an asshole. ",False
likelyGorilla: I think it's unfair that they sit and speak in German when the husband can speak English.,False
"spryCow: I do agree with the person not being an asshole. I think if the mother was really interested, she would learn some German or help the husband speak better english.",True
culturedPig: We know that English can make the husband uncomfortable.,False
niceRhino: I think the son of the mother should volunteer to help her learn how to speak english if she is willing to learn it.,False
culturedPig: That's why this one is so tough.  Everyone is a bit of an asshole here.,False
likelyGorilla: I don't think it's fair to say that just because he's uncomfortable speaking English he shouldn't. Is it fair that the mother is now uncomfortable being excluded in conversations?,False
"spryCow: On the other hand, I think everyone is being a bit of an asshole in this situation",True
culturedPig: He shouldn't have to speak only English but should make more of an effort.  As should the MIL.,False
likelyGorilla: I agree that everyone is kind of an asshole here. I do think the son is more so because he basically sacrificed his mother's comfort for his spouse's. I think he should have found a compromise.,False
spryCow: I mean they can have their private conversations in German and then speak to the MIL in English when they can,True
"niceLion: Why does the mother need to be included? The son should be sharing more with her, but she doesn't need to be in every conversation.",False
conventionalPanda: The son had a bad attitude. He is only there fora short time. He should have been more adaptable to his mother.,False
"culturedPig: I agree, spryCow",False
likelyGorilla: He's with his spouse all the time. He's not with his mother for a very long time. I think they can sacrifice speaking German for the short time they are there.,False
"conventionalPanda: Yes, considering both sides, the son is still the asshole because he is too inflexible, and even with options, chose exclusion of his mother.",False
spryCow: I do consider both sides of this because everyone is being a bit of an asshole but the MIL should be included in a little bit of their conversations,True
likelyGorilla: That's what I think also conventionalPanda,False
niceRhino: I do agree. The mother does not need to be in every conversation that her son has.,False
"niceLion: Like you said they are there for a short time, Why should they change thier primary means of communication just to include her?",False
culturedPig: That's why having this be a binary thing is not great.,False
culturedPig: No room for nuance in the polls.,False
conventionalPanda: true culturedPig,False
spryCow: I agree culturedPig,True
likelyGorilla: He stated he has spoken mainly in German since he's been there. I'm not saying she has to be in every conversation but to exclude her from most conversations isn't right.,False
"conventionalPanda: Like in most things, there is blame to go around but the son is the bigger asshole because he is too inflexible and inconsiderate of ALL concerned. ",False
"niceLion: Do all the convos require her? He seems to be speaking in English when involing her, and German when its just the two of them talking to each other. Just because shes in the room doesn't mean she needs to be involved",False
likelyGorilla: I agree with conventionalPanda I think the son needs to think about his mother also. Clearly he's spoken in German quite a lot if she's bothered by it enough to bring it up.,False
culturedPig: I think the opposite.  The MIL should be a bit more flexible.,False
niceRhino: I think the mother should take responsibility for her self and try to learn how to speak english.,False
conventionalOrangutan: Hello!,False
newRhino: Hellow,False
smallHippo: Hello!,False
smallBison: Hi,False
niceRabbit: Hi there,False
spryMonkey: Hello,False
conventionalOrangutan: I don't understand why she was so bothered by her son's talking in French,False
conventionalOrangutan: I think she was being unreasonable. What do you think?,False
spryMonkey: I think her request was valid,False
newRhino: I think that she was being unreasonable.  There was no need to be hurtful.,False
"smallGiraffe: Hello, I work with people who speak a different language and I find it a bit disrespectful if they exclude me by not speaking so I can understand.",False
niceRabbit: She is 100% not the asshole here.,False
smallBison: I think that she was justified in asking if they would speak English in her presence.,False
spryMonkey: She just wanted to be a part of the conversation,False
"smallGiraffe: I agree, they can speak French when they are not with her and she is hosting them.",False
conventionalOrangutan: But her son's husband doesn't speak English well.,False
conventionalOrangutan: And her son was trying to accomodate him,False
spryMonkey: If they wanted to speak in French only they could have done it not in front of her,False
smallBison: He does but he just has an accent,False
niceRabbit: It's is etiquette 101 that you don't exclude people by conversing in front of them in a language they don't understand.,False
"smallGiraffe: You're right, but he can try when she is present.",False
spryMonkey: agree nice niceRabbit,False
"smallHippo: I think if they were all talking in English and it suddenly shifted to French, it would naturally feel a bit like you were being purposely left out.",False
conventionalOrangutan: I get it but I am sure the French guy did not mean to offend her,False
smallHippo: I can understand her reaction a little bit.,False
smallBison: Yeah like being at the nail salon or something,False
smallGiraffe: That is what it feel like to me at work.,False
"spryMonkey: Plus, they are staying in her house, so they do owe her a level of respect for that",False
"niceRabbit: He speaks English, he's in her home, she's expressed offense - they should have apologized to her.",False
smallGiraffe: She could be nice about it and go mainly through her son.,False
conventionalOrangutan: Well sorry to hear that smallGiraffe,False
smallGiraffe: Thank you,False
conventionalOrangutan: Would she have felt differently if they talked in English?,False
conventionalOrangutan: I am not sure,False
"spryMonkey: Maybe, but at least she would have known what they were talking about",False
"niceRabbit: She speaks English, so she wouldn't have felt excluded from their conversation.",False
conventionalOrangutan: They would have included her in the convo had it concerned her,False
"smallGiraffe: I think have been nicer to talk to her son privately about this, but she is not wrong to want them to include her.",False
smallBison: She at least would know what they were saying. It's human nature to just assume someone is talking about you if you don't understand them,False
smallHippo: I imagine they were all talking in English before that point okay.,False
spryMonkey: It seemed odd that they abruptly ended the conversation too,False
"niceRabbit: It doesn't have to ""concern"" her. They're staying in her home. ",False
"smallHippo: Yeah. It didn't seem necessary. If they moved to speaking French as they were doing something separately, I'd understand.",False
"spryMonkey: true, she could have addressed it privately smallGiraffe",False
conventionalOrangutan: niceRabbit I understand your point but I mildly disagree,False
smallBison: The request could have been handled better but it still doesn't make her an asshole.,False
"smallGiraffe: Well, her method could have been better, but is sounds like we mainly agree?",False
spryMonkey: good point smallBison,False
niceRabbit: It's almost like if you go up to someone in mixed company and whisper in their ear. It's rude. People are going to wonder why you're doing that and what you're talking about that.,False
spryMonkey: agree,False
"niceRabbit: I don't think her son is the asshole, either, actually. I think the partner is. Big baby.",False
"smallHippo: Yeah. That seems natural to me too, niceRabbit",False
conventionalOrangutan: I still think she was insensitive,False
smallBison: I think we have a consensus ,False
spryMonkey: why do you think so conventionalOrangutan,False

niceLion: Hello,False
likelyDonkey: Hello there!,False
conventionalGorilla: hello,False
culturedMonkey: Hello,False
nicePanda: Yo,False
likelyDonkey: A very similar scenario,False
conventionalGorilla: where does everyone stand so far?,False
"likelyDonkey: I want to say ""Not"" but I have a mixed feeling",False
culturedSquirrel: Yeah. I don't know why the son has to choose one or the other. It seems like he could be understanding of both positions easily.,False
conventionalGorilla: i say he is but only because he's in his mom's house again,False
likelyDonkey: The guy made a very tough decision,False
"niceLion: I feel bad for his mom.  She was missing him, and she has a right to be a bit frustrated that her son isn't communicating",False
conventionalGorilla: but in marriage your loyalty is supposed to be to your partner,False
youngGoat: I say he is an asshole because he didn't really make much effort to speak English,False
conventionalGorilla: so he did a good thing by choosing the partner,False
"culturedSquirrel: That's fair, but everyone could put some effort here. ",False
"culturedMonkey: Yes, I think as a mother that I would want to spend every second with my daughter if I hardly got to see her",False
"conventionalGorilla: yeah, but it is her house",False
niceLion: I don't really think he did the right thing,False
likelyDonkey: I sorta think he disrespected his mom but it was a hard choice for him,False
nicePanda: So when they're in Germany does the husband only speak English so his spouse is comfortable?,False
conventionalGorilla: i agree  lik,False
niceLion: I think he disrespected his mother,False
conventionalGorilla: agree,False
culturedSquirrel: Agreed.,False
youngGoat: Yeah,False
"culturedMonkey: I know it would be a hard choice, but the mother needs time with her child",False
nicePanda: Demanding the choice between spouse and parent over something so stupid is controlling,False
"conventionalGorilla: if it was in his own home, then it would be a different outcome",False
culturedSquirrel: It's tough though. I don't think the partner or the mother are wrong. The son could be nicer about it.,False
conventionalGorilla: but it's in her house,False
likelyDonkey: Would ve been much better had he spoke both English and German haha,False
youngGoat: I know I would probably rather keep my wife happy over my mom though,False
conventionalGorilla: haha you,False
conventionalGorilla: youngGoat,False
"culturedMonkey: Yes, the child should try very hard to include the mother for that weekend.  I'm a mom lol",False
nicePanda: This isn't about keeping someone happy. It's about exerting power and control,False
conventionalGorilla: plus it gives the partner a chance to practice English more,False
culturedMonkey: that is true,False
likelyDonkey: I'd say he was not an asshole but I still feel unsure,False
culturedMonkey: I'm thinking he or she probably is,False
youngGoat: I think ultimately he was an asshole,False
culturedSquirrel: Yeah. I think the partner would become more comfortable with English if the son in this situation maybe forced it a bit to accommodate his mother,False
niceLion: I'd say he was an asshole by the way he handled it.,False
conventionalGorilla: i agree with youngGoat,False
likelyDonkey: Well then,False
conventionalGorilla: You don't disrespect your host if you go there for dinner,False
culturedMonkey: They won't be with the mother the whole time and could try to include her when they are,False
culturedSquirrel: Agreed culturedMonkey,False
likelyDonkey: I will join you guys,False
"nicePanda: Yep, asshole. But there's a lot more going on here than shyness about speaking a foreign language.",False
"conventionalGorilla: same in this scenario, you don't not include the mom (in her own home)",False
conventionalGorilla: agree,False
conventionalGorilla: are we at a consensus then?,False
"culturedMonkey: I know it is a hard choice, but they should try to include the mom I think",False
culturedMonkey: yes,False
culturedSquirrel: yep,False
youngGoat: Yes I think so. He's an ahole,False
conventionalGorilla: ahole,False
"nicePanda: Spouse is the real asshole, but there's enough to go around",False
likelyDonkey: I guess you sometimes have to be an asshole. Tough choice though,False
conventionalGorilla: lol nicePanda,False
niceDonkey: She was in a tough position of making her husband comfortable while also including her mother. She had to balance the two.,False
"conventionalBear: I think the woman is being disrespectful toward her mother. The mother is kind enough to let them visit, yet she feels left out. The husband should not feel shy speaking English around his family, and this would be a good place to practice",False
"smallRabbit: Hi! I agree, but they should have made an effort to include her and they were in an English speaking country",False
"snappyGoat: I think that since his husband is a guest in a foreign country, everyone should be a little more accommodating.",False
"snappyHippo: Considering his mother was willing to host them, I think it is fair that they spoke English in front of her and German when they were alone together. ",False
"niceDonkey: She seemed to have spoken to both, she may have spoken in German a bit more, but her husband is new in her life and is likely uncomfortable in that situation.",False
"sprySquirrel: I don't think the onus is on her to accomodate her Mother, she must please with person with whom she is sleeping, her Mother and she can have separate time to themselves.",False
spryWolf: Her mom was nice enough to have them over as guests for the weekend.  I think she was a bit selfish since her mom could not speak German,False
sprySquirrel: the person*,False
"smallRabbit: I feel because they were in her home, they could have tried harder to include her.",False
"snappyCow: I think the issue is that the son needed to speak with his mother aside from his husband. It may be hard for them all to participate in a conversation, but at least they could translate and work something out ",False
"snappyGoat: The mother, as the host, should care about her son enough to be okay with him wanting to make his husband comfortable.",False
"niceDonkey: I do think that since her mother hosted them as guests, she should have included her in the conversation frequently.",False
"snappyHippo: It's not that the husband did not speak English, he was just uncomfortable with it, but practicing it is what would make him more comfortable with it and this is the perfect opportunity for that.",False
"spryWolf: Oh yeah right, this was a HE not a SHE sorry",False
"smallRabbit: No worries, I had to read that twice too.",False
"sprySquirrel: Get the Mother to learn German, learning a new language at an older age is a good way to stave off Alzheimers.",False
"niceDonkey: As long as she would have let her mother know the situation, I think all parties could understand.",False
"conventionalBear: I think the son (not the woman, oops) should be trying harder to include his mother. His mother simply wants to catch up. I doubt she would be judgmental toward the husband.",False
"snappyGoat: But, yes, I do think it would be nice for the son and his husband to at least attempt to speak English around his mother.",False
spryWolf: I feel a discussion should have been between the son and his mother before the visit so this could have been worked out before they arrived,False
smallRabbit: I feel the same way and not being included in a conversation is quite annoying.,False
"snappyHippo: It is probably more uncomfortable for the mother to sit there and not understand anything, then for the husband to go slightly out of his comfort zone to respect his partners family.",False
sprySquirrel: I considered both sides and there are limits to how accommodating one can be.,False
niceDonkey: I would feel bad if I hosted my child and their spouse and they spoke in another language most of the visit. I would feel disconnected and neglected.,False
"snappyCow: I think the mother definitely wanted to catch up with her son, but there's also a problem where the husband would feel left out as well.",False
"conventionalBear: It is his choice what language he speaks, however, if he did not plan to speak in a language his mother understood, why visit?",False
"sprySquirrel: He's not just visiting, he lives there.",False
spryWolf: I feel bad for the mom not able to understand German or be included in their conversations during the weekend visit,False
smallRabbit: The mother doesn't even know if they are saying bad things about her.,False
snappyHippo: He is visiting. It says it was just for the weekend.,False
snappyCow: I think there's a great opportunity for the mother to learn some German and his husband to learn more English so he feels comfortable,False
sprySquirrel: I do not think this person is the asshole but I know everyone else does.,False
"snappyCow: I dont think either one of them are assholes, it just a comfort issue.",False
"newGorilla: I don’t think it is too much to ask that the son and partner speak in a language that all can understand. The son and his partner are the guests and if they are visiting for a week, it is possible that the parent wants to catch up.",True
likelyRhino: They should speak English since she is hosting them.,False
"newGorilla: The son and partner can talk to each other in any language they want, but if it is a group conversation then they should use a common language that everyone understands. ",True
"niceBison: His husband understands English, so he is not unable to speak in English. I can see it being seen as rude to speak in a language that the mother does not understand.",False
"likelyRhino: Yes, they should speak English if the mother is around and part of the conversation.",False
"niceBison: Since he speaks both, it is almost as if he is trying to avoid her hearing what they are saying.",False
"niceWolf: I think its fair that the mother requested they speak in english, but I dont think right for her to be rude and disrespectful, perhaps they didn't know they were doing it",False
culturedCow: I think the mother was correct in thinking that was disrespectful. They could have included her.,False
"newGorilla: However, maybe the parent didn’t ask as respectfully as he/she said and that is actually what offended them. Even so, leaving the room is also disrespectful.",True
culturedGoat: I think a discussion should been made between the mom and her son before the visit.  I feel it was rude and disrespectful to disregard the mom in their conversations,False
"niceBison: He may be more comfortable speaking in French, but I think he should be understanding of the mother's feelings while they are there.",False
culturedCow: They were in her home. She has a right to speak her mind.,False
newGorilla: The parent and the son could still discuss things. The son is the guest.,True
likelyRhino: She definitely has a right to ask them to speak in a language she understands,False
likelyRhino: She is hosting them,False
newGorilla: exactly,True
"smallPanda: The husband sounds extremely rude, if I were her I'd put ex lax in all her SIL's food. ",False
"niceWolf: They were in her home, but that doesn't mean she needed to be rude about it. Just asking them politely to speak in english would have been a better alternative",False
culturedCow: A host should be respected for being nice enough to welcome them into her home. Not be left out.,False
likelyRhino: She said she asked nicely,False
smallPanda: He didn't have to skulk upstairs like a petulant child.,False
culturedCow: I don't she's the jerk here.,False
likelyRhino: She is not,False
"newGorilla: But maybe she didn't ask as nicely as she claims to have asked. Even so, they should be more respectful and speak in English. ",True
culturedCow: Think about going to another country and doing the same.,False
newGorilla: She is right to ask that in her home.,True
"niceWolf: I agree she asked nicely, but she also said ""I find it disrespectful that they’re speaking language I don’t understand and excluding me from conversation."" I feel like it was blown out of proportion""",False
"culturedGoat: No one had to be rude at all, just needed better communication between everyone French or English doesnt matter",False
niceWolf: I agree,False
"smallPanda: French people are rude, it is there default setting.",False
culturedCow: I think it is annoying to not include everyone in a conversation. Especially your guests.,False
smallPanda: their*,False
newGorilla: I'm French. I'm nice. :),True
culturedGoat: Although it is somewhat rude when you are speaking in a language that you know the other person does not understand at all,False
smallPanda: you're the exception...possibly.,False
culturedCow: I don't think the mom was an a-hole at all in this scenario.,False
"newGorilla: I don't think she was at fault here, and is not the a-hole.",True
likelyRhino: I dont think the mother was wrong,False
culturedGoat: No she was not to me either,False
culturedCow: So we all agree?,False
"niceWolf: I don't think anyone is at fault, but it made everyone feel awkward. She could have handled the situation a little better with a joke.",False
littleGiraffe: My  initial impression is that they are not the asshole,False
likelySquirrel: I agree,False
niceGoat: I agree with that as well.,False
spryBear: I disagree,False
likelyPig: I also agree.,False
"smallDonkey: This person is definitely the ""A"" in AITA. This is a false binary, they can easily speak German when alone with their spouse, and do some quick translation during family times.",False
spryBear: I feel that she can help him through the language barrier,False
spryBear: Its only right because they are staying at her mother's house ,False
littleGiraffe: I think they are just trying to make their spouse comfortable,False
"likelySquirrel: I think it's a high pressure situation for the husband, if the mom is offended over this, she may be offended easily and he's worried to make a mistake",False
niceGoat: I don't think either one is an asshole. I think that maybe the husband feels embarrassed and just needs to come forward and explain why he doesn't like to speak English in family settings.,False
smallDonkey: I'm with spryBear The spouse is not even trying to accomodate the mother.,False
likelySquirrel: A lot obviously depends on how good his english is,False
"smallHorse: I agree with niceGoat, it's mostly just a bad situation for the husband and mom",False
spryBear: This should be a time where he can practice,False
littleGiraffe: Yes I agree it depends on his English and that neither person is really an asshole.,False
"smallDonkey: I'm sure the mother does not expect a dissertation, just some basics about the husband and their new life",False
littleCow: She can come to some type of agreement. It's not like he can't speak English. Why be shy around your mother in law. They live with her,False
niceGoat: I think this whole situation could be easily resolved if they would talk with each other without judgements.,False
spryBear: I do not feel that they are completly assholes but he should try,False
likelySquirrel: Agreed niceGoat,False
"smallDonkey: At this point, I feel like all effort is being exerted by the mother.",False
littleGiraffe: I agree niceGoat,False
"smallDonkey: The couple needs to step up, also, as relationships with family are give and take.",False
"niceGoat: I can see how it the mother could find it disrespectful to speak in German in her home too, knowing that she cannot speak it.",False
spryBear: I agree niceGoat,False
likelySquirrel: Yeah it also depends how often they're doing it,False
likelySquirrel: and if the daughter is translating for the mom,False
"smallHorse: I agree the poster could try and include his mother, I'm sure shes just worried she might be doing something wrong and want to be a part of their lives",False
likelySquirrel: I can see it being offensive if she has no idea what they're talking about and no translation,False
"likelyPig: I agree neither is an asshole. They both have valid reasons. But, in my personal opinion, I think the husband should at least try his English. Hopefully the mom would be more  understanding.",False
littleCow: I don't think she even wants to try. She wants to appease her husband.,False
littleGiraffe: I can see it being offensive as well if they are constantly doing it in front of her. It just depends how often it is happening.,False
spryBear: To me it is very offensive to speak another language around others ,False
"smallHorse: The husband does know English, he just has very little confidence in his ability to speak it",False
likelySquirrel: Yeah I'm starting to lean toward the daughter being the asshole,False
niceGoat: Me too,False
likelySquirrel: Seems like there has to be some effort from the couple,False
spryBear: I do beleive that this person is an asshole because she shouldbe respectful to her mother ,False
littleGiraffe: I agree they are slightly the asshole,False
littleCow: I lean more towards she is the asshole ,False
spryBear: Asshole,False
niceGoat: I agree,False
"snappyHorse: The son said it dead on, they are making a big deal over nothing. Sure its not great to be excluded, but you can ask to be included in nicer ways than this.",False
snappyPig: I don't think the mother is the asshole in this situation.,False
smallBison: I don't think she's the asshole either,False
youngGoat: I do not feel that the mother is an asshole ,False
spryRhino: I don't think she is the asshole either,False
littleBear: I think she is the asshole,False
snappyPig: I think she was nice when approaching them about the issue.,False
"smallBison: She may have overreacted a bit, but I can see why it was frustrating",False
youngGoat: I feel that it is only right for them to speak English since they are in her house.,False
"snappyHorse: I recognize her frustration, but she is making a big deal over nothing",False
"likelyWolf: I don't feel like the mother is the asshole. The son's partner knows how to speak English, he just chose not to.",False
smallBison: Especially when he can speak English pretty well it seems,False
smallBison: agreed likelyWolf,False
spryRhino: She felt excluded and they all know English,False
littleBear: They weren't talking to her. It would be different if she was a part of the converstation.,False
snappyPig: How else are you supposed to approach the situation though? There's no easy way to say it. She felt they were being disrespectful and expressed her opinions.,False
youngGoat: He does speak English so why not speak it ,False
"snappyHorse: I feel there is more to his decision not to speak english than ""I dont want to""",False
"snappyPig: I think it's rude to be sitting in the living room and speaking a language no one can understand, especially if the mother is in the room.",False
smallBison: Yeah when the Mom is around I'm sure she wants to be involved in the conversation,False
spryRhino: I agree snappyPig,False
smallBison: Especially in the living room,False
"likelyWolf: I agree, youngGoat",False
"snappyPig: It's one thing if they were alone, but they obviously weren't.",False
"youngGoat: It does not matter if they were not talking to her, but they are in her house and she was sitting there ",False
"snappyHorse: If its a conversation between them, it makes no difference if the mom understands or not since it doesnt concern her",False
littleBear: I agree with the son she made a big deal about it. ,False
"smallBison: Also, it mentioned they were staying in her house for a week so I'm guessing she doesn't get to see her son often",False
spryRhino: Its fine for them to speak French when they are alone but she says they were all together in the living room,False
smallBison: And I'm sure she just wanted to be included as it was a conversation in the living room,False
snappyHorse: Speaking to each other. Might be something a bit private that they dont want mom to hear,False
youngGoat: I agree spryRhino,False
likelyWolf: agree spryRhino,False
"snappyPig: Yea, I would feel excluded if it was my child in my home doing this. I don't think she's wrong for asking them to speak English around her",False
"snappyHorse: Shes not wrong to ask to be included, but I feel she went about the wrong way of doing it",False
youngGoat: I do not think she is wrong either snappyPig,False
smallBison: Yeah she probably could have said it nicer or talked to her son in private,False
likelyWolf: I personally think the partner took it too far. What if he was the one that didn't understand the language? Wouldn't he feel left out?,False
littleBear: I feel that's rude and entitled. Now things will be awkward. She could have pulled him to the side,False
"snappyHorse: It might be he doesnt really understand the language, or has anxiety about speaking it",False
spryRhino: Yes maybe she could have approached it differently ,False
littleBear: likelyWolf I agree,False
"snappyPig: She could've pulled her son aside yes, but I felt like it was respectful of her to approach them together",False
youngGoat: I do not feel that it was rude. She addressed both of them at the same time. This way it does not make the partner feel that she is going bhind his back in a way.,False
spryRhino: True it was good to address them together so it's not behind the partner's back,False
littleBear: Well the partner was embarrassed so he left. It was her tone. ,False
snappyPig: He was kind of rude to leave the room,False
snappyHorse: She addressed them by saying she found them disrespectful over nothing,False
smallBison: Impossible to know what her tone was unfortunately,False
littleBear: I conclude she was the asshole ,False
"youngGoat: Overall, I do not feel that she is an asshole. She addressed the issue at hand in front of both. And honestly, I do not feel that she meant any harm.",False
snappyPig: I don't think she was the asshole,False
youngGoat: Not an asshole,False
"smallBison: Agreed, not an asshole",False
"youngCow: Despite his edit, I think he was probably disrespectful in telling her this based on the tone of his post.",False
youngHippo: I really think he's in the wrong here. He's clearly not being considerate and doesn't care. I don't think he's thinking from the MIL's perspective at all. And I agree with his other family members that he's being privileged. ,False
smallPig: I absolutely think he's wrong,False
niceGiraffe: I think she is wrong.   In 8 years she should know how to speak the language.,False
"youngCow: OTOH, she should try to learn English.",False
conventionalSquirrel: My impression is that the MIL is in the wrong,False
youngHippo: The edit was just him backtracking. Who knows if he was actually polite in the way he said things to his mother in law. ,False
smallPig: Especially if he was frustrated...I don't think there was any politeness at all,False
conventionalSquirrel: The husband provided her online learning resources and directed the MIL to ESL classes but she refused to be helped,False
"youngHippo: It's not ok for someone to be rude in any situation. And in this situation, he's completely inconsiderate. We don't know if she refused help. ",False
youngCow: Older people have a tougher time learning languages.,False
"youngHippo: She might be learning but still needs help. He's not providing the whole picture. And I agree, it's a lot harder for older people to learn new languages.",False
"youngHippo: Especially when they're not exposed to the new language, which seems like the MIL is not.",False
"smallPig: I noticed how he indicated that he told her in the beginning paragraph that he was 'sick of her s**t"", but then later tried to edit it to say that he didn't really say that.  I feel like he's definitely not being honest",False
niceGiraffe: She could have at least made an attempt at trying to learn either with classes or by him training her.,False
conventionalSquirrel: I agree that is harder for older people to learn new languages and that we don't have the full picture of how much effort the MIL is putting in,False
youngCow: Any consensus?,False
smallPig: I believe that he was being close minded,False
youngHippo: I'm still thinking that he's in the wrong. ,False
smallPig: I agree,False
youngCow: I think he's the asshole.,False
youngHippo: Anyone else have any closing arguments?,False
smallGiraffe: I don't think she's in the wrong. But I think her attitude could be a little better and she could thank her husband for helping her mother.,False
"snappyMonkey: Her husband married her, not her mom. She said her parents have worked hard to make it in this country, well learning English would help.",False
"niceCow: I don't think she is in the wrong either, I think he was being selfish",False
"smallGiraffe: The mom is probably not asking for help all the time, just occasionally. So the husband is being inconsiderate and should try to help out when he can",False
snappyLion: I can see both sides but I err on the side of the husband not being wrong,False
"niceCow: I feel like when you marry someone, you do have some responsibilities to the family as well, and why wouldn't you want to help out your family?",False
snappyHorse: I think parents should have taken online class or husband tutor parents to learn English.  ,False
snappyLion: It would be helpful to know how often her mom calls the husband,False
smallGiraffe: Agree,False
niceCow: I don't think it's a reasonable expectation for the parents to get online to learn,False
"snappyLion: Based on the info provided, its probably very often if he is getting frustrated",False
niceCow: My parents barely know how to sign into a computer.,False
"smallGiraffe: But I still say at the end of the day, it doesn't take much for the husband to help. And older people have a harder time learning languages.",False
"snappyMonkey: She said he he has also been incredibly helpful in bridging cultural gaps., so he has been helpful.",False
"smallGiraffe: I think she's not necessarily in the right, but I wouldn't call her an asshole. ",False
niceCow: I would hope that my partner would be willing to help my parents out,False
snappyMonkey: Just depends on how often.,False
"snappyLion: In the long term, it is better for the parents to try to learn English. It could just be maybe like once or twice a week.",False
niceCow: I noticed she indicated it was 10 minutes every once in awhile.  I would hate to think that my partner wasn't willing to give up 10 minutes to help my parents out.,False
smallGiraffe: They could be in the process of learning English but still need the occasional help translating.,False
"smallGiraffe: So given that, I still say she's not the asshole.",False
"snappyLion: Yeah for sure, its not an issue for harder issues but maybe it is the trivial things throughout the day that frustrate him",False
snappyMonkey: I'm inclined to say she is not the asshole.,False
niceCow: I don't believe she is the asshole,False
smallGiraffe: I don't think she's the asshole either.,False
snappyHorse: I agree she's not the asshole.,False
culturedWolf: this person is the asshole,False
littleRhino: yup that's what I thought too,False
smallRabbit: I agree as well. ,False
snappyCow: I think she's only asking for a little bit of time from him,False
snappyCow: She is working and going to school.  He is free.,False
spryBear: I disagree that she is the asshole. I don't think either of them are necessarily.,False
smallRabbit: Sounds like it has gotten to be more than a little bit of time though. ,False
newDonkey: I agree as well. I think she was tired of translating and put it on him.,False
"snappyCow: Yes, they both have good points.",False
snappyCow: I think there is room for compromise here.,False
culturedWolf: certainly,False
"smallRabbit: Sure there is, but if we have to decide one way or another i this she is the arse here. ",False
culturedWolf: she should make it so that he's not 100% taking these calls,False
littleRhino: yeah,False
"culturedWolf: i guarantee she has ten minutes to spare every day, just as he does",False
spryBear: Yeah it's hard to say. I do think she should ask him how he felt about it before putting it on him,False
snappyCow: That would be more fair,False
newDonkey: The family has been here a long time and need to be learning English,False
conventionalGoat: I think she shouldn't just assume that he is willing to help just because he also speaks Spanish too,False
"snappyCow: At the same time, she makes a good point that he is their family too",False
"spryBear: Agreed, they both clearly don't want to do it, and it is rude that she assumes he will do it.",False
newDonkey: He has a right to his feeling about the situation ,False
smallRabbit: Then as a family they should discuss how to move forward as it doesn't sound like it is working for them right now. ,False
"snappyCow: She's asking him to share the load, that's all.",False
culturedWolf: they may share equal blame too,False
newDonkey: It does sound like they are communicating. Which means that he has heard her out.,False
smallRabbit: She has asked him to take on the load not share it,False
"conventionalGoat: However, they should come up with a system that works for both of them.",False
spryBear: I think they both could have been more communicative,False
snappyCow: I think they could work together and the parents could take English lessons as a compromise too,False
smallRabbit: Agree,False
"littleRhino: Right, it's fine every once in a while. But if he's doing it the vast majority of the time, it's not really fair.",False
snappyCow: Communication is key.  You're right.,False
newDonkey: They should get the parents an English coarse to help them learn English ,False
"conventionalGoat: Definitely, they could communicate with her mother to share that they don't always have time to help, but they will help when they can. ",False
spryBear: But it's hard to say who is more at fault for the lack of communication. What do you guys think?,False
"snappyCow: I agree, newDonkey",False
"snappyCow: I think both probably are at fault, but the husband sounds kind of like a whiner.",False
smallRabbit: She is at fault because expectations were not set before she started up schooling. If they had discussed this in dvance it wouldn't be an issue. ,False
"conventionalGoat: In a lot of countries, family helping each other out is just a cultural assumption. ",False
spryBear: I agree smallRabbit She even shot down is alternative solutions he gave,False
snappyCow: I'm inclined to believe that she is partly to blame but is not an asshole.  They both need to communicate and work on a solution.,False
newDonkey: A marriage is about five and take and this is something that they will need to workout to find a compromise for I do think she is the asshole for just assuming but it doesn’t make her a bad person ,False
conventionalGoat: I think maybe the pressure she is putting on her husband comes from her heritage. ,False
littleOrangutan: this guy is probably the asshole,False
conventionalPig: The tone it what got me on this. ,False
youngGoat: yeah I felt that too,False
littleOrangutan: im not sure that he would be the asshole if the tone was more polite,False
"conventionalPig: I get being frustrated about the situation, but there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it",False
"snappyGiraffe: His tone isn't good, but he has some points.",False
littleOrangutan: but i doubt that he was polite with his mother in law,False
"nicePanda: This one is a little complicated. I think even if his tone with her was kind, the inner tone would still come through.",False
"littleOrangutan: and this is exactly the type of situation where being polite might get your way, and he blows it",False
snappyGiraffe: I think he is trying to find a way to approach it better.,False
littleOrangutan: however the idea that his ability to learn multiple languages in a relatively short time would equate to his MIL doing the same is ridiculous,False
"snappyGiraffe: I think wanting them to try is fair, however.",False
"conventionalPig: Well, still 8 years is a long time....",False
"youngGoat: And it wasn't like the mother was calling him all the time, only when she couldn't get a hold of her family. ",False
"nicePanda: Definitely. People learn languages at different paces. Some people are really good at it, others are not. ",False
"conventionalPig: Still, what would the mother do if she can't get a hold of anyone and it is an emergency?",False
snappyGiraffe: There is still a certain amount of effort they should be putting into the process.,False
"conventionalPig: Agreed, but they need to discuss it as a family to decide how to move forward. ",False
"snappyGiraffe: I think his tone is annoying, but I don't think he's an asshole.",False
"nicePanda: I think, it would be good to encourage the MIL to do more things on her own when she can so that he is empowering her to be more independent, but also understand more of where she is coming from.",False
"snappyGiraffe: True, nice",False
"nicePanda: I think he is the a, but only because his heart towards his MIL is not very good. He could be more understanding  and less frustrated by her asking for help. ",False
nicePanda: He should have the freedom to voice when he doesn't have much time though. ,False
"snappyGiraffe: I think he could use some personal skills in handling this, but I don't think his feelings are invalid.",False
"niceGoat: I think in this scenario, she makes a great point that her mother is now his family too.",False
"culturedMonkey: I think they are all adults. The husband does not have to answer the phone. He can call her back, request a time, ask for an email, and more. Her mother is a part of the family now.",False
youngGorilla: I think the husband should be willing to help. He is part of the family now and if the wife is busy he should help if he can. ,False
culturedMonkey: Agree niceGoat,False
smallRhino: I don’t think she is the asshole. Her husband speaks Spanish too so it isn’t that hard for him to translate. He said some very racist things about her parents not learning English. I think the husband is definitely being an asshole.,False
"likelyHippo: I believe she is not an asshole. She believes that he married her and her family. By not being willing to translate (every so once in a while) she is hurt. He does not recognize the hurt, which makes him the asshole.",False
culturedMonkey: Agree youngGorilla,False
snappyPanda: I totally agree. She is not an asshole for it after all he is apart of the family now,False
culturedMonkey: Agree likelyHippo,False
"snappyBison: Okay, I believe that the husband should make an effort to help out. When you marry, you marry not only the other person, but the family",False
likelyHippo: I agree with everyone too,False
culturedMonkey: wow. we all agree!,False
youngGorilla: If it is a problem for him then they should discuss a better option for the time in question. ,False
youngGorilla: YAY,False
smallRhino: Agree with way you all are saying!,False
snappyBison: Yes they should come to a compromise for sure,False
snappyPanda: Exactly youngGorilla,False
snappyBison: so she is not the asshole,False
"likelyHippo: I think the key here is that they disagree on what marriage means, which set her up for being hurt in this situation. ",False
smallRhino: Not the asshole,False
snappyPanda: correct snappyBison,False
culturedMonkey: not the asshole,False
youngGorilla: not the asshole,False
snappyPanda: not the asshole,False
likelyHippo: There is definitely some cross cultural gaps that need to be bridged.,False
"culturedMonkey: Considering both sides, I am sure he is busy as everyone is. Mom can't call several times a day and expect to hear his voice",False
youngGorilla: The husband has right to feel the way he does but he should be more willing to make compromises that work for all parties and not be so selfish. I do understand his frustration just not his repsonse. ,False
culturedMonkey: agree,False
likelyHippo: Agree,False
niceGoat: I also think with so many resources like google translate,False
culturedMonkey: Oh good point niceGoat lots of resources out there.,False
culturedMonkey: I also think the wife is correct that expecting them to learn the language at this point is unreasonable.,False
youngGorilla: Mom might like playing with google :) ,False
niceGoat: But 10 minutes in order to help doesn't seem too bad,False
youngGorilla: Agree culturedMonkey that is unreasonable at this point in their lives,False
snappyPanda: Yes. There definitely should be more communication there and compromise. If he is busy he can consider a time convenient for him. ,False
"likelyHippo: Even if he is stressed, his comment about her parents needing to learn english is hurtful. Why should they assimilate?",False
"niceGoat: Yes, not everyone can learn a language easilt especially English which is hard",False
snappyPanda: After all he did start off at first helping.,False
snappyBison: the women is not the asshole,False
"culturedMonkey: In summary, she is not the asshole and he should help out family when he can.",False
conventionalGiraffe: I think the guy is privillaged for thinking that anyone can learn english--it is a very difficult langauge to pick up.,False
youngDonkey: I think this guy is the asshole. He is racist. He  is rude towards the wife,False
smallCow: I think that the Son in law could have been a bit more compassionate in expressing how he felt,False
niceSquirrel: He was very rude and disrespectful. He could have talked much nicer. He could compromise. Set up a certain time of the day he is availbable. ,False
youngLion: He’s an asshole. No 2 ways about it. The family has a right to say he’s being racist. His white make privileges are showing.,False
smallPanda: The son-in-law is over-reacting to the situation. He is a member of the family. He needs to be more compassionate with them and understanding.,False
conventionalGiraffe: Also the family is not asking for that much help,False
smallCow: He was an asshole for the words he spoke to his MIL,False
"smallPanda: He has many options: he can not answer the call, ask for an email, ask for a text, coach them on some words, but really, he should understand that they need help.",False
conventionalGiraffe: He obvioslly picks up languages easily but not everyone does,False
youngLion: Agree smallCow,False
niceSquirrel: Its a simple need and not hard to help with. He is just being an asshole. he is part of the family. how would he feel if someone was like that with his mother,False
smallPanda: agree,False
conventionalGiraffe: I also agree,False
youngLion: Agree niceSquirrel,False
"youngHorse: I disagree. I believe he is guilty of being an elitist and privileged, but not an asshole. If he genuinely does not want to help, and he wants to give them the resources to learn, I do think he was the right to that.",False
"smallPanda: Considering all sides, maybe they are calling too many times per day or making too many asks?",False
smallCow: Possibly smallPanda,False
conventionalGiraffe: Do you not think he has an obligation to help his family?,False
smallPanda: His reaction makes him an asshole.,False
conventionalGiraffe: I agree with smallPanda,False
niceSquirrel: No two ways about it. He was an asshole. He could have been more kind to find a workable solution,False
niceSquirrel: the asshole part is how he reacted. ,False
conventionalGiraffe: I think he is the asshole.,False
"culturedRabbit: i think she is being an asshole. I think her logic that her parents are immigrants and they worked hard, therefore its an expectation her husband translate, is flawed",False
spryHippo: I think the OP is the asshole because she is just passing off work she doesn't want to do to her husband.,False
"smallBison: I agree, I don't think she should expect her husband to automatically take responsibility without having a conversation.",False
culturedHorse: The girl is the asshole in this case. Her husband should not be the sole helper for her mom. ,False
snappyBear: Even if it's only for a few minutes? Also we don't know how often her parents call to ask for help.,False
snappyBear: I do think her parents should try to learn a little English though for being here for so long.,False
"culturedRabbit: i get the familial thing, but by expecting him to ""step up to the plate"" also just feels demanding on her part",False
"culturedHorse: That;s true. But it sounds as though it's frequently. And yes, they should be learning English.",False
"smallBison: Yeah I don't think the issue is how long, I think it's the principle of it",False
newGorilla: I feel like this could be solved with more communication. They shouldn't feel entitled that the husband HAS to help.,False
snappyLion: I feel the husband is just getting tired of answering their requests. ,False
"culturedRabbit: well i dont fault the parents for not learning english, but her expectation that she can just pass the call to her husband to assist feels weird to me",False
"spryHippo: Also why does she not want to help her parents herself? It is bad enough when my parents call me for tech support in english, imagine your mother in law  needing that translated. She just doesnt want to do it herself",False
culturedRabbit: are you all bots?,False
smallBison: No,False
spryHippo: Nope i am human,False
culturedHorse: I'm not a bot. ,False
spryHippo: ......or are we?,False
"culturedRabbit: anyway, she an asshole",False
smallBison: ^,False
culturedRabbit: i think we all agree,False
spryHippo: yup agreed,False
smallBison: Guilty,False
culturedHorse: I think so too.,False
snappyBear: Yeah her being a full time student isn't an excuse to help her mom for a few minutes a day haha,False
culturedHorse: She should step up for her own parents  more than he should.,False
spryHippo: so hows everyone day going? i am waiting for a cake to bake while doing this,False
culturedRabbit: i am making a baked potato,False
spryHippo: oo delish,False
culturedHorse: Fine here. Thanks for asking. ,False
snappyBear: Made a coconut cream pie for scratch before this!,False
culturedRabbit: has newGorilla said anything,False
culturedRabbit: snappyBear,False
smallBison: More like oldGorilla,False
culturedRabbit: we need unanimous decision!,False
snappyBear: yeah they did,False
culturedRabbit: oh woops lol,False
smallBison: :(,False
culturedHorse: She is the asshole for assuming her husband should take the greater role.,False
"likelySquirrel: i think hes an asshole.  i get wheres hes coming from, but the way hes going about it is 100% asshole.",False
niceGoat: I think the way that this guy approached it and his mindset makes him the asshole,False
niceGoat: yep lol,False
"littleWolf: Yeah, I think his mindset makes him the asshole too",False
littleBison: Yeah i think he might be leaving something out of the story with the way hes wording it,False
youngPig: It sounds as though he has been thoughtful about i. He has asked her to learn English so she's not so dependent on him. Seems fair to me.,False
likelySquirrel: true there can be a difference in the way he spoke to his mother in law versus his true thougts,False
"littleWolf: Yes, but he wasn't genuinely looking out for her good, it was just a way for him to disguise his annoyance",False
niceBear: I'm on this guy's side. It's probably getting old translating for this woman. He was being helpful recommending helping her learn English.,False
youngMonkey: She can't even do basic errands without him so I would understand why he would be annoyed.,False
"littleBison: It is true she should be a little   more independant, but there has to be something that happened in between for them to call him an asshole trump supporter",False
"likelySquirrel: but if hes so concerned, maybe something like - lets practice english together, or lets practice duoloingo together",False
likelySquirrel: i think we can all agree we understand why hes annoyed and bothered,False
littleWolf: Yeah I agree with littleBison,False
"youngPig: Anyone who is a Trump supporter is called an asshole. Yes, we can agree why he's annoyed.",False
littleWolf: I don't think we're getting a full story here,False
"likelySquirrel: but the way hes going about it -is an asshole way like saying stuff like ""its not that hard""",False
"likelySquirrel: heres a difference between telling someome that youre sick of their shit, versus explaining that he cannot be translating everything",False
youngMonkey: It's true how he words it makes him an asshole but overall she should be learning English. They translate everything for her so she doesn't feel a need to learn.,False
likelySquirrel: its not the reason why hes mad that makes him an asshole - its how hes going about it,False
littleWolf: Wait who here doesn't think he's an asshole,False
youngPig: Guy admitted at the end that he did not speak to her in the way he mentioned in the beginning. I don't think he's an asshole.,False
youngMonkey: You shouldn't just go around telling people they need to learn English but the fact that she expects that she can use him as a translator all the time makes him not an asshole.,False
"littleBison: I dunno the way he wrote out that story sounds other wise, hes definately leaving out details ",False
littleWolf: I don't think because the mother is blameless suddenly makes him not an asshole too,False
littleBison: both people assholes yes i agree,False
likelySquirrel: i mean i get it - he prob feels used,False
littleWolf: but it isn't justification to also be somewhat of an asshole,False
"likelySquirrel: yeah, i agree - hes going about it all wrong",False
littleWolf: there's just better ways to resolve this situation than a spontaneous moment in a phone call,False
youngPig: Mother is too dependent. He was not an asshole. Just trying to get her to stand on her own two feet.,False
youngMonkey: That's why I feel like he's not an asshole in this situation because she needs to know at least a little english for emergency situations,False
likelySquirrel: hope everyone is staying healthy and safe!,False
littleWolf: Social distancing 👏,False
likelySquirrel: omg how did u add an emoji,False
littleWolf: copypaste,False
spryRabbit: My initial impression is that the person is the asshole in the situation.,False
"likelyLion: My initial impression is that no, this person is not an asshole. She is right that in marriage, your spouse's family becomes your family.",False
conventionalPig: My initial response is they are not,False
culturedGorilla: I think she is being a little bit of an asshole because she assumed her husband would take on translating without asking him frist,False
niceSquirrel: I don't think she is the asshole. The inconvenience of translating for a family member is less than the benefit gained from the person being able to navigate life.,False
conventionalPig: No she asked him to help at first and the mom just started going to him,False
"likelyLion: And since they are part of the family, her husband should be willing to help out. ",False
likelyBison: My initial impression is not an asshole.,False
"conventionalBear: i don't think she is an asshole, you help family.",False
"niceSquirrel: Well, it doesn't say she didn't ask him. This sounds like something they have discussed.",False
spryRabbit: I agree with culturedGorilla I think she should take into consideration what he feels before she just gives him tasks he doesn't want to do,False
likelyLion: And I would also think that her husband would be more understanding of cultural differences,False
"culturedGorilla: This is tricky. Fam helps fam, but no on should be obligated to do so",False
niceSquirrel: We know what he feels - he feels he doesn't want to because they should just learn to speak english,False
snappyHorse: My initial response was that yes she is being an asshole. She says her family came to America and want to live the American life. I think they need to compromise. ,False
spryRabbit: However I do think her husband is being an asshole based on how he handles the situation,False
conventionalPig: He wasn't upset at helping at first from what it reads like but ever since the mom just started calling him for help is when it changed,False
conventionalPig: I agree hubby is the butt,False
"likelyBison: I think the husband should've said something too, before he got irritated from translating for her parents.",False
"snappyHorse: Yes help family, but her parents can take some time and try to learn. ",False
likelyBison: snappyHorse,False
culturedGorilla: I agree with conventionalPig and spryRabbit,False
niceSquirrel: Why is someone assuming they are not trying to learn? learning a language takes time /,False
spryRabbit: I think they are both in the wrong and kind of both being assholes,False
"likelyLion: I understand it may be a little annoying to have the mom calling a lot, but you make sacrifices",False
conventionalPig: I agree likelyLion,False
"niceSquirrel: even if you are learning you may not understand, for example, the instructions on a medicine which can have specialized language",False
"snappyHorse: In the reading, she says they should have to learn on top it everything. I disagree. ",False
likelyLion: and that's true niceSquirrel learning does take time,False
culturedGorilla: or legal documents!,False
"likelyBison: snappyHorse depending on her parents ages and the culture they came from, they may not learn English as quickly as others.",False
snappyHorse: *shouldnt,False
spryRabbit: I think maybe the problem is that she is not the asshole in the situation but the way she writes is making her come across as one,False
"conventionalPig: i think the couple should sit down with parents and set up rules for calling - like how often, etc",False
conventionalPig: set up expectations so he still is helping but feels like he is being heard too,False
niceSquirrel: Yes that is a good idea to have boundaries such as when it's ok to call and when he is unavailable. that is reasonable.,False
"likelyLion: That's a good idea, have discussions and boundaries that could work for everyone",False
"snappyHorse: I agree with conventionalPig Times, days ect",False
culturedGorilla: they are both being assholeish due to lack of communication,False
conventionalPig: so to me not an asshole,False
culturedGorilla: So! who is the asshole?,False
"niceSquirrel: I agree, the writer is not the asshole.",False
"likelyLion: Same, I don't believe she's being an asshole",False
"likelyBison: In conclusion, both aren't assholes.",False
conventionalPig: i think hubby's attitude is more being an asshole but the situation just needs boundaries,False
"snappyHorse: No one is the asshole, they just need to compromise and set boundaries. ",False
conventionalPig: yes,False
culturedGorilla: ok so we agree and non asshole! yay team,False
likelyBison: agree with snappyHorse,False
smallGoat: This guy is the asshole.,False
smallGiraffe: My initial impression is that he is the asshole,False
spryWolf: I agree a complete butt,False
smallGiraffe: He also just has no idea what he did wrong ,False
spryWolf: yes he does,False
spryWolf: he just doesn't want to admit he is wrong,False
"culturedHorse: Initially I thought he wasn't a butt, but, on a cultural level, you just don't do that kind of thing to your elderly inlaw's",False
spryWolf: that is why he id defensive,False
smallGoat: yeah seems like he lacks empathy and doesn't understand why other people's situation is different than his.,False
"conventionalMonkey: My initial impression is an asshole but I realized on his ""edit"" that he said it in a nicer way to her. ",False
likelyDonkey: My initial thought was he is an asshole. At the end though when he edited to say he was polite and had a nice tone then I am not so sure. ,False
"conventionalBison: It's interesting to see the scenario we previously looked at from the other side. Even with that though, hearing his side, he's still an asshole. ",False
smallGoat: Yep,False
culturedHorse: agree with conventionalBison,False
smallGoat: sounds like we already agree,False
spryWolf: looks like it,False
culturedHorse: Well that was easy,False
smallGiraffe: Yup sounds like there's not much need  to debate,False
spryWolf: lol,False
"conventionalBison: I don't know if he was being honest with his edit, or if he was getting flack and tried to back pedal ",False
"conventionalBison: I agree, it's open and shut lol",False
smallGiraffe: It sounded like he was getting attacked and wanted to defend himself,False
"conventionalMonkey: True, conventionalMonkey",False
"spryWolf: he may have been honest in the edit, people get heated when they rethink things",False
conventionalMonkey: i mean conventionalBison,False
spryWolf: especially if he is getting crap from the family,False
likelyDonkey: True. Someone got on him. ,False
"culturedHorse: (also, not everyone knows the USA doesn't have an official language. in fact, most don't)",False
spryWolf: I always thought it was English,False
conventionalBison: I think we all considered both sides here,False
smallGoat: yep,False
smallGiraffe: YEs,False
likelyDonkey: Agreed,False
"culturedHorse: spryWolf one would think, but there is no official, federal language",False
"conventionalBison: Nope, there's no official language. But obvious most of us speak English, and only English",False
conventionalBison: obviously*,False
conventionalMonkey: US is full of different languages. There's no official language.,False
smallGiraffe: I read somewhere that English is the hardest language to learn which completely negates his argument about him learning other languages in a yeat,False
"smallGoat: even if it was the official language, learning a new language is still a process",False
smallGiraffe: year*,False
smallGoat: yeah plus sometimes people say they learned a language in a year but really they are not fluent like a native speaker,False
conventionalMonkey: I conclude that he is an asshole then.,False
culturedHorse: yep,False
"conventionalBison: We agree, the person is an asshole",False
likelyDonkey: yes,False
"smallGoat: yep he is the asshole, easy conclusion",False
spryWolf: yes,False
smallPig: Hi everyone! :),False
niceBear: hello,False
niceRabbit: Hi,False
newSquirrel: Hi,False
conventionalLion: Hello!,False
spryOrangutan: Hi,False
niceBear: so she's the ah,False
niceRabbit: I think so too. I don't think he should be expected to help all the time.,False
"youngGiraffe: I think we've all been annoyed at some point when our parents ask us for help with something again and again. We help them anyway though, if we can. I'm talking stuff like tech support or legal documents.",False
"culturedGoat: I feel like the person is the asshole because he is the buffer between his parents and his spouse. With any issue between a married couple, family is usually, for me, a hot button issue. ",False
spryOrangutan: I think she's being a bit of an AH - they are her parents and it seems like she's dumped all the responsibility on her husband.,False
conventionalLion: I agree. I understand being busy but she needs to help too,False
youngGiraffe: I'm inclined to agree that the husband should help. Especially because his reasoning seems so petty.,False
niceBear: she should not have just passed it off on him,False
niceBear: share it,False
"culturedGoat: If the person whose parents don't know how to create boundaries early on, this will constantly be an issue.",False
spryOrangutan: She is busy but it's not really fair to dump it all on him.,False
smallPig: I honestly don't think shes the asshole because it is normal for immigrant families to rely on first generation Americans to help their parents,False
youngGiraffe: She's working full time and getting a Masters. That's a lot. It sounds like the husband doesn't have all that on his plate. ,False
smallPig: Yeah she's really busy,False
niceRabbit: It is just the part where she pased the full responsibility to him all the time that bugs me.,False
culturedGoat: She seems over sensitive about the immigrant issue and not on the issue of her wanting her husband to drop everything every time her parents need something translated. ,False
youngGiraffe: Why not be happy his mother in law has a relationship with him and that he can help his wife?,False
niceBear: it is a lot but she shouldn't underestimate his job,False
spryOrangutan: It would be better if she could at least ask him to help then he would not feel so put upon.  It's a two way street,False
"smallPig: I feel like she can play a part in helping her parents, but it doesn't make her the asshole.",False
niceBear: plus they make fun of him... not cool,False
newSquirrel: I take responsibility for my families issues and I expect my wife to take care of hers. It never seems to work like that though as she always makes exceptions for her family. So I empathize with the guy in this scenario.,False
spryOrangutan: It just seems like she's not respecting that he's busy as well,False
niceRabbit: I agree newSquirrel,False
conventionalLion: I agree with new newSquirrel,False
spryOrangutan: She should be more considerate of her husband and they should try to work it out.,False
smallPig: Yes they should try to work it out,False
niceRabbit: I can also see her point. But I think she is being unreasonable. The guys has put up with a lot.,False
culturedGoat: I would not want to put my husband in the same position if it were my parents that needed something. I would want to be the buffer and would try to not make him feel put out.,False
niceBear: yes I agree they need to work out maybe times it's ok to call for help,False
youngGiraffe: How has he put up with a lot?,False
"newSquirrel: I don't mind helping out here and there, but it states that he gets directly called by her family EVERY time.",False
spryOrangutan: I still believe she's being somewhat unreasonable and taking advantage of him.,False
"niceRabbit: He has been helping out, but she just expects it now and that isn't fair.",False
"culturedGoat: It's as simple as momma sending husband a text asking if he is free for a few minutes so he has the ability to say ""Now is not a good time."" or ""Sure, I'd be happy to help.""",False
conventionalLion: I disagree with the husband saying the family needs to learn English but there needs to be balance. ,False
spryOrangutan: I agree with niceRabbit,False
"youngGiraffe: I'd like a little bit more information on the situation, but why shouldn't you be able to expect your spouse to help you?",False
"smallPig: I agree, culturedGoat",False
"culturedGoat: Make the husband feel like his time is valuable as well,.",False
spryOrangutan: I agree with culturedGoat,False
"newSquirrel: Which sounds like a bit much. I'd say shes expecting too much, so in that respect she is TA. I don't think that he shouldn't ever help out, but I don't think he should have to do every translation.",False
"spryOrangutan: I believe there is fault on both sides, but that the wife is being a bit more unreasonable than the husband.",False
"likelyRhino: If this guy's reasoning was what he told his MIL it was, I could understand, but it's clearly not why he really said something.",False
niceHippo: I sympathize with this guy because my mom usually comes to ask me for translation help all the time. This is why I feel that multi-generational families usually depend on each other when it comes to translations.,False
culturedGorilla: I think this guy sounds like an asshole the way he asked his question. But I think he might have been more respectful in person.,False
"smallOrangutan: I think if he hadn't put the edit in there, I definitely would have thought he was the asshole. However, to me, this is something the wife should have handled as the middle-man and the husband should never have had to handle it.",False
culturedGorilla: I would not like it if I was being constantly asked to do translations.,False
"niceHippo: The way he phrased his writing made him sound like an asshole, but he treated his MIL with respect if he really did tell her so in a respectful manner.",False
likelyRhino: As someone who struggles with learning other languages I think this guy is being really unfair in that regard.,False
"likelyPig: In general, I don’t think he’s an asshole for not wanting to be a translator. ",False
youngSquirrel: This is a tough one. On one hand he shouldn't have told her she needs to learn English. It is hard and he must have a knack for languages so he doesn't understand,False
"likelyRhino: But he lied to her about his real reasoning. Also, based on what he says about his family, it sounds like he's probably not as respectful as he said he was.",False
"niceHippo: It is definitely hard to learn a new language, but I can understand why he wants to encourage his MIL to learn.",False
niceHippo: He was nice enough to provide resources,False
"culturedGorilla: It might be rude, but if I lived in another country I would do everything I could to learn the language. I don't think that is privileged.",False
"spryMonkey: I can empathize with this guy as it's irritating dealing with other families issues, but she only contacts him when she can't get anyone else. He also doesn't tak into account different things are harder or easier for other people. ",False
"smallOrangutan: If I moved to another country and only knew a few people who could translate for me, I would want to do everything I could to be able to feel comfortable with the language on my own and be independent.",False
likelyRhino: While trying to survive in that country and support a family?,False
"culturedGorilla: It's not bad to ask for help, but the MIL should be trying to learn.",False

culturedBear: small smallMonkey,False
"niceGiraffe: Even though they were being hosted in his house, they should be able to expect to be able to speak their language in some privacy",False

newHorse: I think that this person was doing the best they could with the given situation and it's not really their fault,False
niceBison: I agree new,False
niceBison: newHorse,False
culturedCow: He should have communicated this with his mom,False
newRhino: I think they should try to make the host comfortable and included,False

culturedCow: I agree with newRhino,False

newHorse: Well he CAN but not as comfortable,False
newRhino: Agreed snappyPanda,False
"niceBison: I think that they should try to include her in conversation yes, and they could've conveyed to the mother that he is not super comfortable with speaking english so that she could be more understanding",False
culturedCow: If hes in someone elses house he should make them comfortable,False
culturedCow: They needed to communicate that with her,False
"niceBison: But at the same time, it's difficult because he is stuck between trying to make his husband comfortable and trying to make his mom comfortable",False
newRhino: That is true niceBison. There should have been more communication,False
"niceBison: And my unpopular opinion is that when you marry someone, they become first priority",False
culturedCow: I see both sides but its just manners and etiques,False
newRhino: It should always be best to respect the host,False
"snappyPanda: Speaking some German is fine, but not all German, it's rude to the mother. If they all speak English, then everyone can understand the conversations. If German is spoken, that leaves someone out every time. ",False
niceBison: So making his husband comfortable was potentially more important.,False
culturedCow: It rude to make someone feel uncomfortable in their own house though,False
newRhino: Exactly snappyPanda and culturedCow,False
"niceBison: I agree they should have probably made a larger effort to speak more english and convey that the husband was uncomfortable to his mother, but I still don't not know that this miscommunication makes him an asshole",False
"snappyPanda: The German husband CAN speak and understand English, he should make it a point to communicate with his mother-in-law, not exclude her. ",False
newRhino: It is not an asshole but the asshole.,False
culturedCow: It makes him an asshole because he feels like his mom should automatically get it,False
"newHorse: Right, more communication from both sides is always good, and they were stuck between two frustrating options",False
newRhino: In other words is he in the wrong here?,False
niceBison: I suppose the other side is that he is not going to get more comfortable if he does not try to speak more english with her,False

culturedCow: he should make her more comfortable,False
"snappyPanda: Good point, niceBison ",False

"smallGoat: By the poster's admission, the husband has already been very helpful. The phrasing also bes the question of whether or ",False
culturedCow: I think this person is the asshole. Her husband shouldn't be obligated to translate every time she asks,False
youngGorilla: It seems that the poster just sort of dumped this translation responsibility into her partner's lap without having a conversation about it. ,False
"littleHorse: The guy married the whole family but I wonder exactly how she ""asks"" him to help",False
smallGoat: not he learned SPanish specifically because of the family. It is not his obligation,False
"smallGoat: to help the in-laws simply because they are in-laws. If he tries to set a boundary, then it needs to be respected even",False
niceHippo: I think she should call her daughter first and ask if the husband is free and willing to help at the moment,False
"littleHorse: I get that he should feel like helping sometimes, but it sounds like it has become an obligation for sure. What makes her time more valuable than his?",False
"youngGorilla: Yes, I agree that it is not his obligation here. If he wants to volunteer to help, that's great! But neither his partner nor her family should expect/demand it.",False
smallGoat: if the other partner is working more.,False
youngOrangutan: I don't think it's difficult for him to translate since he knows Spanish and it's helping out his family,False
"youngGorilla: It's not a question of the difficulty of the translation, but the assumption that he is obligated to do so.",False
culturedCow: I agree gor,False
littleHorse: It probably isn't difficult for him overall. It sounds like he is resentful of the obligation. I'm not sure that makes his wife an asshole,False
youngOrangutan: Okay I'll agree that he shouldn't be demanded to translate every time.,False
"smallGoat: I didn't get the impression it was difficult, either",False
"youngGorilla: Because now he is ""volun-told"" to do this task.",False
"littleHorse: I kind of didn't like the ""ridiculous and privileged"" assumption comment she made though",False
niceHippo: I think the mother is imposing herself too much but she cant help it. I think it is okay if the wife is working more than her husband and he has more time he should help it,False

niceHippo: not asshole,False
youngGorilla: Asshole,False
smallGoat: asshole,False
littleHorse: asshole,False
youngOrangutan: asshole,False
littleHorse: I think asshole because of that statement about privilege and the lecture about America being made up of immigrants.. when really it's a family thing.. He's tired of being put on the spot.. It has nothing to do with immigration,False
youngOrangutan: niceHippo what is holding you back,False
littleHorse: So she's an asshole for basically calling HIM an asshole for not wanting to be constantly at someone's beck and call,False

littleHorse: It's fine :),False
smallGoat: YOu are entitled to your opinion,False
littleHorse: absolutely!,False
littleHorse: I just prickle at her reasoning about it,False
littleHorse: I still felt he should help... but her attitude irritates me,False
"youngGorilla: That's the fun part of actually doing this on Reddit! I always like reading all the comments. But in this case, I think she's the asshole for assuming/demanding this.",False
littleBison: I think the speaker's frustration in his words makes it hard to know what's actually happening here.,False
"youngCow: I think since the mom only asks the poster when no one else is available, poster is the asshole for getting so upset",False

"littleBison: Good point, youngCow",False
"spryHippo: I kind of feel like they're both being jerks, but the mother-in-law is overstepping her bounds and needs to respect her son-in-law's boundaries.",False
snappyMonkey: Who does she ask when someone else is available? Did it give that information?,False
smallRhino: I think MIL is being a littleBison bit imposing here and the son is law is right about what he said,False
"snappyWolf: I really hate when people throw ""white privilege"" in the mix",False
smallRhino: I think it is about trying,False
"snappyWolf: He's frustrated and it is a family issue, so why do that?",False
"littleBison: I do think it's unreasonable of him to say ""I learned a language super quickly and you can, too."" It's hard to do it!",False
"youngCow: It says ""when she can't get ahold of other family members""",False
"spryHippo: I think that's probably a real factor, though.",False
snappyMonkey: Yes I am leaning towards siding with the poster,False
"smallRhino: just give it a try, you should be able to learn and he was willing to help",False
"spryHippo: I agree with that, littleBison",False
snappyMonkey: They called him a trump supporter and racist. seems disrespectful to do that,False
smallRhino: true,False
"spryHippo: If they say that, it's most likely true",False
"littleBison: Yeah, that part insulting him was not cool",False
"snappyWolf: The mother has been in the country for 8 years, true, but if she is insulated in a Spanish speaking community, I can totally understand how she wouldn't have learned English well at all",False
"littleBison: If that part is true about what they said/how they treated him, it's a huge problem. But I'm not 100% sure I trust the poster based on the edit and his bias.",False
"youngCow: I think if he really phrased it how he did in the edit, that was a lot nicer and more reasonable",False
"littleBison: Good point, snappyWolf",False
snappyMonkey: Would a racist trump supporter really marry a latin woman and take the time to learn spanish and portuguese?,False
snappyWolf: I honestly don't feel like he's an asshole at all and think he just got frustrated and she probably calls on him more than not,False
smallRhino: getting out of the bubble and learning everyday words with help from her SIL should not be that bad,False
smallRhino: yup..for almost everything,False
snappyWolf: I agree smallRhino,False
spryHippo: But why did he learn Spanosh or portugese? He also learned Russian. Might now have had anything to,False
spryHippo: do with his wife's family,False
"snappyWolf: I don't think she should be bashed for not learning English, but he shouldn't be bashed for not wanting to be a translator all the time",False
smallRhino: witch hunt,False
smallRhino: lol,False
littleBison: I feel like this would be an ESH (everyone sucks here) on actual Reddit,False
snappyWolf: Likely so,False
"spryHippo: I agree that the wife and MIL are in the wrong here. It's not the husband's responsibility regardless of his beliefs about race or nationality, or his own race",False
snappyMonkey: It is also important to think about how an English speaker would feel if they immigrated to a foreign country and didn't speak the language. It is probably scary.,False
snappyWolf: I think he is probably not the asshole and that obviously a nerve was plucked in the family over the whole thing,False
youngCow: I understand his frustration and wanting the mom to be independent.,False
"littleBison: But since we have to choose one side or the other, I guess I'm learning toward not the asshole",False
"spryHippo: I agree, littleBison littleBison Thank you for teaching me that term! lol",False
smallRhino: I agree he is trying to make her MIL independent. I like that guy,False
youngCow: I agree,False
snappyMonkey: so we are voting NTA?,False
littleBison: Ha ha! :) AITA is a really fun forum on Reddit! I highly recommend it,False
"snappyWolf: Yes, reading into that, he really sounds like he cares a lot about her",False
youngCow: Yes,False
snappyWolf: not an asshole!,False
snappyWolf: lol,False
littleBison: I would learn NTA in this case,False
littleBison: *lean,False
"spryHippo: I hate not being able to vote ESH, but....I, too, lean NTA ",False

smallOrangutan: Hi,False
youngGoat: Hi,False
smallMonkey: hi,False
youngBear: Hello all,False

smallOrangutan: I think since the situation is only temporary while she get's her Master's it's ok.,False
"spryDonkey: I dont think this person is the asshole lol, the husband should help he did marry her.",False
youngBear: Poster is definitely not the asshole. Helping the MIL for a few minutes is part of being married.,False
youngGoat: I believe the poster is TA and she providers the argument why: she says it is only 10 minutes every once in a while that the mother calls.,False
spryDonkey: Yep I agree youngBear,False
conventionalSquirrel: I believe that the woman is not being the asshole because she is in school and if the translations are short it should not be a problem,False
"youngGoat: She expects her husband to have 10 minutes available, but she does not?",False
smallMonkey: do you think he is an asshole. i think he is because it only take a few minutes to help out,False
littleRhino: My inintial impression is that this person is not being an asshole. It will not kill the husband to help his in laws translate and help them with English. ,False
"smallOrangutan: I also don't think she's TA, they are family and this isn't to much of a hassle",False
spryDonkey: The husband should not mind helping out the in-laws every once in a while,False

spryDonkey: Sounds like he is a Big Asshole!,False
youngBear: A smart husband will do small things like this to make his spouse happy! ;),False
conventionalSquirrel: If she is actually busy with college and the husband is just available i don't see a problem,False
"youngGoat: If the task of translating indeed does not take long and only occurs infrequently, then why can she not make any time for her mother. Is she really that busy that she cannot spare 10 minutes every so often?",False
"smallOrangutan: Definitely, youngBear He should be more helpful like this while she gets through college",False
spryDonkey: Yes it's really no big deal and they did accept him into the family so why not help?,False
smallMonkey: is the question on being an asshole referring to the husband?,False
littleRhino: She is busy in school and are not necessarily available when her parents need her while her husband is available,False
"smallOrangutan: I think it refers to the wife, who wrote the post.",False
youngBear: smallMonkey the question is if the WIFE is TA,False

smallMonkey: then she is not an asshole. sorry,False
"youngGoat: I disagree, the wife is the asshole",False
smallOrangutan: It sounds like many of us are agreeing that she is not TA.,False
conventionalSquirrel: I do think the parents should learn english ,False
littleRhino: Agreed the husband is the asshole here,False
smallMonkey: yes,False
spryDonkey: All except young youngGoat I think,False
"youngBear: I do think it would be fair if the husband occasionally said, not now, I'm busy, but that doesn't make the wife TA",False
smallOrangutan: except for youngGoat,False
spryDonkey: They should learn yes but damn he can help,False
youngGoat: But he has been helping.,False
"youngBear: Or ""honey, there's no way I can talk to your mom tonight, can you talk to her?""",False
littleRhino: The parents needs help though learning English and if the husband can help them why does he have a problem with it,False
"youngGoat: it is not that he said he will not help. He has been helping, but it has now reached a point that he wants a reprieve.",False
smallMonkey: no,False
"smallOrangutan: Yes, he didn't need to accuse them of needing to learn English. It's harder when you're older to learn a language.",False
spryDonkey: He should be greatful they accepted him into the family,False

culturedBear: i believe  he is not asshole .  the mil needs to learn how to speak english.,False
"snappyGorilla: I don't think he meant to be an ""asshole"", but he has came across as one to his wife's family",False
conventionalDonkey: Not everyone can pick up languages like he can.,False
youngRhino: The husband seems to be annoyed he has to translate. Should he just tell the mom to get someone else to do it sometimes or call less,False
snappyGorilla: No he obviously has a knack for languages.,False
"youngRabbit: I think it would be OK for husband to tell MIL ""don't call at work"" but telling her when and how to learn english is rude",False
likelySquirrel: It must be very frustrating to him that he feels he is only a translator,False
"conventionalDonkey: I think he should be glad to have an ""in"" with the family as a translator. It's a good way to be liked an accepted.",False
"youngRabbit: And maybe she just wants to talk to him, to make him part of her family. Would be nice to have a MIL that talks nicely in any way!",False
likelySquirrel: His in laws should be respectful and not bother him at work,False
"snappyGorilla: I think he should help them, but if he is busy he does not have to answer the phone!",False
conventionalDonkey: I agree youngRabbit,False
conventionalDonkey: Yes he can set a boundry about work for sure,False
conventionalDonkey: boundary ,False
youngRhino: The family should not attack him or call him racist for trying to get the mother to learn the language that 99% of the country speaks,False
youngRabbit: conventionalDonkey and snappyGorilla very smart and true!,False
snappyGorilla: I also think that they all need to learn to be more considerate to one another.,False

snappyGorilla: Yea good idea likelySquirrel,False
youngRabbit: likelySquirrel Genius!,False

"conventionalDonkey: It's up to the MIL and her husband and their culture, etc. whether they want to learn English, but they don't need him tell them to do it",False
"conventionalDonkey: Yes, he is TA. Plus it's only temporary while his wife is in college",False
culturedBear: he can be. haha. yes then,False
youngRhino: this is not the same story?,False
youngRhino: it does not say the wife is in college,False
snappyGorilla: He should just not answer when he is to busy otherwise help those damn immigrants!,False
"conventionalDonkey: oh lol, figured it was his side of same story ",False
culturedBear: verdict?,False
likelySquirrel: The husband should not be judge to harshly this has been going on for 8 years maybe he is just not have the patience to teach I know I don't,False
youngRabbit: The countries were different but it did sound like the same story,False
sprySquirrel: They really seemed like the asshole ,False
spryHorse: I think that the MIL should try to learn the language after 8 years of living here.,False
smallRhino: He is unkind and disrespectful. ,False
"youngPanda: Not the asshole. OP could have definitely told their mother in law in a more gentle way, but OP is still right. Mother in law can't depend on everyone around her forever.",False
"sprySquirrel: it sounded like he was the person she called last, so it cant have really been that often too",False
"smallRhino: If he does now want to translate for her, he should make himself unavailable but the way he tells the story shows that he does not want to help her.",False
spryHorse: I think he's frustrated and after 8 years.,False
"youngBison: He is the asshole, don’t have to translate if you don’t want... but you don’t get to tell her what to learn",False
smallRhino: I think he would be impatient helping her learn English and it would not work even if he wanted to do it. I just think he doesn't want to be bothered.,False
sprySquirrel: yeah,False
"spryHorse: It's for her own good, what if she has an emergency and can't communicate with medical personnel? Some hospitals have people that can translate, but some don't.",False
smallRhino: She should learn it but you can't make her.,False
newMonkey: I do not think he is an asshole because he tried to help her with resources to help her learn English on her own in a very nice way. It can be very annoying to be randomly be receiving random phone calls to translate for the grandmother. ,False
smallRhino: It is her choice.,False
"youngPanda: It's definitely not the best way to tell her about it, but his feelings are valid. Not everyone can cater to your language needs 24/7",False
"spryHorse: It sounds like she has refused to learn at all. I'm sure he was really frustrated and lost his temper with her, which he shouldn't have done. He should have had a discussion with the family.",False
smallRhino: He comes across as annoyed but it is not his responsibility to teach her.,False
"smallRhino: Yes, the family should help as a group.",False
"youngPanda: If she really wants a constant translator around, she could hire one. Otherwise, don't expect much help from family, especially when it bothers them often",False
sprySquirrel: I'd be interested to know why the whole family thinks he's an asshole if he really was just sort of rude in saying no,False
smallRhino: Her daughter might be the key person to help out. Could be an in-law issue.,False
youngBison: It is her choice to learn it or not.  Like it is his to translate or not.  He would not be an asshole for making the choice to not translate.  It seems as if he came off like her was trying to tell her she had to learn it.,False
newMonkey: Exactly it sounds like she just wants to be lazy and not put in the effort to learn because she has these people to help her always. Although it is harder to learn a language the older you get and idk just how old the mother is,False
culturedHorse: She shouldn’t assume it is up to her to decide what her husband does with his time.  She is the asshole,False
smallSquirrel: She's the asshole. Your husband's feelings are just as valid as your parents.,False
"culturedPanda: I feel that she may be the asshole here. Everyone is busy, but it sounds like the translation burden has been increasing for her husband.",False
newBison: There is a fundamental clash of cultures here. He does not respect her culture and she has expectations for him based on her culture that may be unfair to him.,False
culturedHippo: I agree with that,False
smallSquirrel: Same,False
"culturedHippo: Although I can't decide if theyre both the asshole, or neither is the asshole",False
newBison: Both are. This marriage is in trouble.,False
"culturedPanda: It has to be difficult, because he's not just translating but also having to explain the material to them. That could really wear on you after awhile, especially for years.",False
niceGoat: I think she is kind of an asshole if she expects him to do it all the time. He should be expected to help out sometimes if its not consistent but like another person said here she should not decide what her husband should do with his time.,False
newBison: He married into this.,False
"culturedHorse: Well, this sounds like unanimous assholes based on forced translation expectations.",False
niceGoat: Plus it sounds like she has siblings since she is the oldest why dont they help?,False
"culturedHorse: Unless, there was a prenup on translations while working full time and in school.",False
newBison: Yes! Her family should help more.,False
"culturedPanda: They need to come together as a family and decide how best to handle the language gap. If I moved to another country, I would learn the language so that I could function and get around.",False
culturedHippo: Her last couple lines also made it sound like she really doesn't respect his time.,False
"newBison: This issue will not be all they face. For example, which language with their children speak? They need counseling.",False
culturedPanda: I would be constantly worried about my parents if they couldn't speak the language. What if an emergency happens?,False
newBison: She doesn't and is ugly about his views. Disrespect all around.,False
"smallSquirrel: It's reasonable to want your parents to get help for whatever they have trouble with, however it is not reasonable to hurt others by expecting them to do things they don't want to do.",False
newBison: They both need attitude adjustments.,False
culturedPanda: I think I would loose my temper about this if I was the husband. I can see why he became upset.,False
culturedHorse: And google translate ,False
newBison: There are bigger issues than just this.,False
newBison: So do we all agree? Both assholes?,False
"culturedHippo: Yeah, they don't seem to be communicating effectively about it with each other",False
culturedHippo: Yeah,False
culturedPanda: It sounds like they have some fractures in their marriage and this is the straw that broke the camel's back.,False
culturedHorse: I agree on her being asshole.,False
"smallSquirrel: They either make a compromise or the marriage is in trouble, disagreements happen but if no one is willing to compromise then problems only grow as the marriage goes on.",False
"culturedHippo: I assume we can only say if the OP is an asshole or not, so I think all we can say is yes",False
culturedPanda: I do believe that she is the asshole in this situation. They all need to come together and figure this out.,False
"snappyRhino: He is not being an Ass, But he handled it wrong. ",False
"smallLion: At first I was like wtf man but then reading that he spoke to her respectfully about it, I think he wasn’t an asshole",False
youngPanda: I agree ,False
snappyMonkey: I agree. Until the edit part I did think he was being an asshole but he sounded like he at least tried to be nice,False
youngPanda: you ,False
"niceDonkey: Yeah, first impressions, even by his own words, he was being an ass, but then clarified that he was trying to be respectful about it.",False
smallLion: I think he’s looking out for her and trying to make life easier for her,False
snappyMonkey: It is hard situation as I do feel for her mother in law,False
snappyRhino: He should have asked politetly for her to not call him during certain times that can be disruptive and then offered to help her learn English,False
snappyMonkey: Maybe she has a really hard time learning a new language,False
snappyMonkey: Yes maybe he could have put some boundaries on it,False
"niceDonkey: yeah, he didn't handle it well. And if its not a good time for him to be her translator, he shouldn't pick up the phone, or should and politely state that now is not a good time and to contact someone else",False
"smallLion: English is a hard language to learn, but even learning the basics so she can go the store/ect would be helpful and I think that’s what he was trying to tel her",False
snappyRhino: I live In So Cal so this stuff happens all the time here. But really its all about how you approach it,False
snappyMonkey: Yes hopefully in the long run his conversation is helping her get up the confidence to learn English,False
snappyRhino: But you dont want to ignore a call and have it be an emergancy.. its kind of a catch 22,False
"youngPanda: he gave her alot of re sorceress to learn and yes boundaries are needed, but she needs co consider that he has a life too and cant drop everything to translate",False
smallLion: I can understand his frustrations though. ,False
niceDonkey: yeah. And it did sound like he was willing to help her learn. He just came across at first as being a jerk about it.,False
snappyRhino: The Family needs to help her learn English and be supportive so she can be more independant. He is just the only one willing to say it out loud,False
youngPanda: I think maybe he could try and teach her basics especially in case of an emergency ,False
"niceDonkey: And she may just feel more comfortable with him, which is why she contacts him more so than anyone else",False
"smallLion: His first way of saying it was terrible. But if he gave her resources and info and offered help, I truly think he’s looking out for her best interested",False
"niceDonkey: I agree, ",False
snappyMonkey: Me too,False
snappyRhino: His Wife needs to help too. She should be more willing to teach her mother too for safety reasons,False
snappyMonkey: I think we all agree he wasnt being an asshole over all,False
youngPanda: yes,False
"niceDonkey: yeah, ",False
smallLion: Exactly,False
snappyRhino: yep agreed,False
smallGiraffe: Yep She is an Asshole. She might try to write it prettier but yep its her.,False
"likelyPig: So I get that she's busy, but she shouldn't expect him to drop everything to do favors for her mom. She should ask him if its a good time for him to help out, and be accepting of his answers.",False
smallGiraffe: Sorry but if she is going for her MASTERS then she knows tht learning a new language is doable,False
"conventionalSquirrel: Okay first of all I don't think the poster is the ass for trying to help her mother, but she kind of is for putting it on her husband",False
niceLion: The line about helping mom only 10 minutes every once in awhile really got me. If that is all it is why can't she help too?,False
"likelyPig: Very true, 10 minutes once in awhile is nothing, if she wants to be helping her family. ",False
niceLion: Yes I think the fact that she is making her husband do it all the time makes her an asshole,False
smallGiraffe: And its her parents not his. She has passed them off so often that they are leaving her out of the loop. That tells you that they thing she is an ass too.,False
likelyPig: She's not taking into account his time and priorities.,False
"likelyPig: Very good point, they are bypassing her for a reason",False
spryMonkey: She states her husband should make time but also states she’s too busy so she passes it off. Like what?!,False
smallGiraffe: And that privelege remark. Sorry honey but there are community classes taht teach englisha nd they are affordable,False
"conventionalSquirrel: I think its the mother in laws fault, if i lived somewhere for a long time and constantly needed help i would be asking my family to help me learn so i don't have to bother them as much",False
spryMonkey: What would she do if her husband didn’t learn Spanish? ,False
likelyPig: Some classes are free in fact.,False
"likelyPig: And by helping out all the time, they are also enabling the mother.",False
smallGiraffe: But the kids are enabling her and then putting all on the Gringo to help them as if its his responsibility,False
conventionalSquirrel: I understand to her its normal to her at the same time because she has been doing it all of her life,False
smallGiraffe: her nicely worded way of telling us seems way moore offensive than his did.,False
niceLion: I see your points about enabling but I think ultimately in this situation the daughter is being an asshole,False
"conventionalSquirrel: so i don't blame the wife, i blame her mom",False
spryMonkey: I think the fact her husband has even been helping while she’s ‘too busy’ makes her an ass,False
"likelyPig: Yeah, culturally, but as she points out, there are benefits to learning otehr cultures as welll, and it doesn't sound like she is taking into account, her husband's culture.",False
smallGiraffe: yep I think we agree she is an ass,False
likelyPig: yep,False
spryMonkey: Defintly,False
conventionalSquirrel: i don't agree,False
"likelyPig: I can kinda see both sides, here, but she's being an ass",False
niceLion: I also think shs is ,False
spryMonkey: The fact she expects of her husband what she doesn’t want to do makes her an asshole to me,False
"likelyPig: It seems as if instead of taking turns, she's pawnign it all off on him.",False
spryMonkey: Exactly my thoughts too,False
"conventionalGiraffe: I think this guy is very rude, this is his mom's house not a german hostel.",False
snappyWolf: I think he should have been more repectful to his mother.  ,False
"snappyRabbit: Well, I think that he should have been speaking English. After all, his mother doesn't know German at all. ",False
snappyRabbit: And at least his husband knows *some* English.,False
snappyMonkey: I think he should have translated for his Mom what they were discussing ,False
culturedDonkey: So I can see both sides of the story however the wife and her husband are the asshole. He should have sucked it up and spoke english. who cares if he is embarrased. They are in her moms house ,False
"snappyRabbit: Yes! That, if nothing else, would be polite.",False
spryPanda: He should see this as an opportunity for his husband to learn more English and be kind to his mother.,False
"snappyRabbit: That's a good point, too.",False
"conventionalGiraffe: I think it is quite selfish of his husband, he obviously had no interest in getting to know this woman.",False
snappyWolf: It shouldn't matter if his husmband is uncomfortable speaking english.  I think the mother would have understood that he is from a foreign country and couldnt speak english very well.,False
spryPanda: He should include his mother n the conversations and translate back and forth.,False
snappyRabbit: I think she would have appreciated at least the effort to speak English.,False
spryPanda: agreed,False
culturedDonkey: I agree,False
snappyMonkey: Yes he should have made an effort,False
"conventionalGiraffe: It looks like the consensus is that this guy is the asshole, I see no scenario where this would be acceptable.",False
snappyMonkey: agreed,False
spryPanda: agreed,False
"snappyWolf: I agree, he is an asshole.",False
snappyRhino: i agree,False
"snappyRabbit: I don't know if everyone has technically responded, but it's all been agree so far! And, we still have time on the clock. :) ",False
snappyRhino: hes thge ass,False
snappyRhino: the*,False
spryPanda: We did consider both sides and have agreed that he is an asshole.,False
snappyRabbit: Yes.,False
conventionalGiraffe: I've tried to consider both sides but these two are so rude.,False
"snappyWolf: I did consider his feeelings about not wanting to make the husband uncomfortable and if that was the case he should have, as others stated, translated for hit mother.",False
"snappyRabbit: I remember being stuck in a group of French exchange students. Very awkward not knowing French, so I feel they should have, at least, translated.",False
conventionalGiraffe: I also have been around french people who refused to speak english.  Most germans I have met speak it quite well.,False
"snappyRhino: i feel like both sides can be arses. The inlaws for not making the guest feel welcomed, and the guy for being  disrespectful. but in the end, dude is thee arse!",False
culturedDonkey: He should have at least made the effort- im sure the mom wouldnt have jugded the english ,False
snappyRabbit: We all seem to agree that the couple was in the wrong and very rude.,False
snappyMonkey: I think the fellow is an asshole becuase he didn't include his Mother in his converstations with his husband.  He could have trasnlatedfor his Mother to understand . e that would have helped his husband to learn more English.  ,False
spryPanda: I just voted,False
conventionalMonkey: I don't think the mother was an asshole.  ,False
"youngCow: Hi Everyone. I think that the dominant language should be spoken. In other words, the language spoken by the most people.",False
snappyGoat: I dont think that its unreasonable for the person to want the guests to speak english in their house.,False
"culturedRabbit: It's the woman's home, not an airbnb for french tourists.  If you can speak english, don't be so rude.",False
youngCow: I think they should have translated or just spoken French privately,False
conventionalSquirrel: SHe was justified in asking the men to speak in english or at least translate in order to include her.,False
"youngCow: And yes, spoken English because she is the host.",False
nicePig: I agree- it is not unreasonable for everyone to speak english especially since the boyfriend can speaak english,False
conventionalMonkey: I think that he should have spoken English so she could understand and translated anything his partner didn't understand. ,False
youngCow: I agree.,False
snappyGoat: The husband can speak english and chose not to.  That is disrespectful.,False
conventionalSquirrel: I agree.,False
"youngCow: If they were further away, I would understand if they didn't consider her as part of the same conversational space, but it seems they were pretty close in proximity.",False
nicePig: Agreed- very disrespectful at least speak english when the mom is around ,False
"culturedRabbit: I think it would be equally rude if she was visiting their place and they sat there and spoke French, why even visit if you're not going to talk?",False
conventionalSquirrel: It could be a learning experience for all of them.  She could learn a little French and the husband could refine his English,False
conventionalSquirrel: I agree with culturedRabbit ,False
"youngCow: Just to play the opposite side...perhaps they have closer talking distances than in the U.S., so they felt she was out of the ""zone"" of who was within range.",False
snappyGoat: I could agree with that point.  But if you are going to visit a foreign country you should at least try to learn the language before you go.  This guy on the other hand already knew how to speak english.,False
youngCow: But I don't really agree with that.,False
conventionalMonkey: I like that idea conventionalSquirrel a learning experience for the partner and the Mom. ,False
youngCow: I also agree. Good experiences for both,False
youngCow: It seems pretty unanimous. ,False
youngCow: I think it was also rude of the husband to leave shortly afterwards.,False
snappyGoat: I agree.,False
snappyGoat: If they wanted to bridge the gap they could have just spoke english as everyone knew how to.  But instead the son decided it was best to try to make the mother feel uncomfortable.,False
"youngCow: Seems like it, yes.",False
smallHorse: My initial impression of the user is that he wantes to please both mom and husband,False
"likelyDonkey: I think the first thing I considered was that they are only in US part time, so that is impacting the mother's response",False
likelyDonkey: yes!  he does want both to be happy,False
"smallHorse: I thought so, too. The user wants to make sure they are both happy.",False
likelyGorilla: I don't see why they can't speak to their mom in English to catch her up on their life. ,False
smallGoat: She make the very right decision ,False
likelyDonkey: But I think hearing more English would help the husband,False
smallHorse: He is also considering how uncomfortable English makes the husband. ,False
"niceOrangutan: I believe he wants to please both sides, but he shouldn't allow his significant other to make him choose",False
likelyGorilla: The husband will only get more comfortable with English if he actually tries to apply himself and use it.,False
"smallHorse: I thought the same things, why can't he fill the mom in in English!",False
"likelyDonkey: yes, the husband said speaking is hard,but I know sometimes hearing another language isn't as hard",False
smallGoat: Though her husband too should learn more English ,False
smallHorse: I can agree with that. ,False
"likelyDonkey: It would be different if the husband spoke no English, but that's not the case",False
niceOrangutan: He should be able to speak German and translate and English at the same time; and the husband should learn to at least speak English. ,False
"likelyGorilla: Yeah, he will still know what they are saying. He can respond in German and the daughter can translate it.",False
smallHorse: Maybe hearing the language could help the husband in areas he is uncomfortable.,False
likelyDonkey: They are staying at the mother's house -- it's wrong to exclude her while they are her guests!,False
likelyGorilla: I think they are just being inconsiderate to the mom which honestly makes me think they are the asshole.,False
"smallGoat: Translating might not be too easy, depending on the conversation thogh ",False
niceOrangutan: I agree ,False
niceOrangutan: But at the same time it's not easy for the mother to figure what is being said as well,False
likelyDonkey: I think they need to be more considerate of the mother.,False
"smallHorse: I can see how this is a difficult situation for the husband, but I'm wondering if there could be a compromise for both the mother and the husband. ",False
"smallGoat: Both side should try to adjust, the mother should be more understanding and the the husband should learn more English ",False
"likelyDonkey: yes, maybe some time spent in English",False
smallHorse: I agree with that!,False
niceOrangutan: I agree as well,False
likelyGorilla: I can't wrap my head around not filling his mom in on what's going on in English. Why would you be that difficult? ,False
smallGoat: Right,False
niceOrangutan: I don't understand why that would be difficult as well,False
smallHorse: I don't either!,False
smallGoat: She is not,False
"likelyGorilla: The son is making things more difficult than they have to do and frankly I think he's being disrespectful to his mom. So yeah, he's the asshole.",False
niceOrangutan: Yes he's an asshole for not including the mother,False
newHorse: I think the mother was justified in saying they should speak english.,False
sprySquirrel: I am not really sure if this person is an asshole or not ,False
youngPig: I thin the mother has point ,False
"conventionalWolf: I agree, they were being rude",False
newHorse: I don't think the mom is. They should know that they could be uncomfortable.,False
littleBear: I lean towards not an asshole because the person speaks English but just has an accent. There's no reason they can't speak English around the mom.,False
"youngPig: Yes, they were rude, making her not comfortable",False
conventionalWolf: To expect her to sit there and be excluded was not very caring of the son. ,False
"newHorse: I agree with that! If the person couldn't speak english, it would be different.",False
sprySquirrel: I don't understand why they can't speak both English and French,False
"conventionalWolf: Exactly, the SIL can speak English.  Why wouldn't they?  ",False
sprySquirrel: Both the person can speak English,False
littleBear: Yeah if the SO wants to speak French the son could translate for the mom.,False
"newHorse: Right, if they wanted to talk about something private, they should go away from the mom.",False
youngPig: Yes she is not TAH,False
youngPig: That is right.,False
littleBear: I agree ,False
sprySquirrel: It would be rude if the man couldn't speak English at all,False
conventionalWolf: I can't think of any arguments to support the son in not using English,False
"newHorse: I can't either, He should use it around his mom",False
littleBear: I guess if he cares more about the comfort of one over the other. But that is definitely asshole behavior.,False
"sprySquirrel: But to accommodate the mother they should speak English, knowing that the mother does not speak French.",False
"conventionalWolf: Occasionally using French would be fine, but when she joins them, it would make sense to switch to English. ",False
newHorse: I can see how the mom wants to be included and I can also see how they may want to talk more privately. But that should be done away from the mother.,False
littleBear: I'm saying the son's behavior is asshole-ish not the mom.,False
youngPig: Neither can I defend the son's behavior too,False
"conventionalWolf: yes, the son is TA",False
sprySquirrel: So I believe the mother is not an asshole ,False
newHorse: me too,False
conventionalWolf: The mother is not,False
youngPig: Yes the son is TAH,False
conventionalWolf: I think the fact that she is hosting them for a week shows that she is welcoming to the SO,False
youngPig: The question is about the mother been the HA,False
newHorse: The person is not an asshole.,False
youngPig: Yes ,False
littleBear: Mom is not the asshole.,False
"sprySquirrel: Yes, the mother is not an asshole",False
youngPig: Mom is not the asshole.,False
"likelyGiraffe: We're currently staying at my mother's house for the weekend, and she's been gracious enough to host us and provide us meals. It's been nice seeing family again.",False
spryHorse: She should hve spoken to her family in english because she was at their house. She could have interpreted for her husband.,False
"likelyRhino: She should consider the fact that her mother is being generous and letting her and her husband stay at her home and feeding them. Her mom only has a simple wish which is to feel included, so she should just do that. ",False
sprySquirrel: Do you think he is an asshole for speaking German?,False
likelyGiraffe: he says he hates that he sometimes doesn't know the right words. And for me in particular he just prefers German. So we almost always speak German to each other.,False
snappyGoat: The person speaks English and German. The husband speaks English though not perfectly. The mother only speaks English. The Author could speak all English or both languages.,False
likelyGiraffe: yes,False
newBear: although it is time comsuming to translate she should be taking the time to translate for her mother or spend private time with mom while speaking in english,False
spryHorse: I do think he was being harsh to her parnets by not trying to speak the only language they could understand.,False
newBear: there are also very simple apps that can be useed by all parties ,False
"likelyRhino: It seems that English is somewhat of a ""universal language"" compared to German, so I think her husband would understand the English. He also did mention that he has difficulty with speaking or knowing some words.",False
"sprySquirrel: I think he needs to do a little of both, since his husband understands English",False
spryHorse: He was being disrespectful to her parents and she was accomidating that behavior. Disrespectful.,False
conventionalHippo: My impression is that this guy is not the asshole. He is a grown man and married. They have made decisions within their marriage about the language they wish to use.,False
spryRabbit: The husband doesn't feel comfortable speaking English. This obviously isn't the first time the mother has met him and probably knows this if she has spoken to him before. ,False
"likelyGiraffe: My mom says I'm the asshole for not including her, that it's disrepectful and she wants to be caught up to my life after I been away for so long. I think the language I speak is my own choice",False
"spryRabbit: However, not knowing what is being spoken in your own house could be quite jarring,",False
conventionalHippo: Is he not allowed to speak english to his mom?,False
spryHorse: Yet the mother only understood english. The daughter should have shown her some deference.,False
likelyRhino: That's a good point but I think the mom just wants to feel included and also might feel like she was being talked about in another language which makes her uncomfortable.,False
likelyGiraffe: Though my husband speaks English he can be shy about it-,False
conventionalHippo: Because if he is then none of this even matters,False
"snappyGoat: I think she is an asshole. Rude to her mom, and the husband soes speak English, just not well.",False
"sprySquirrel: I think it's disrespectful, to an extent. In other words, he needs to find common grounds.",False
likelyGiraffe: It means I have to choose between including my mother in the conversation or making my husband comfortable. ,False
newBear: Asshole is a bit harsh - maybe inconsiderate. ,False
"likelyRhino: I wonder why she even has to choose sides, just speak English with her mom when she is around and go back to speaking German when her mom isn't around.",False
snappyGoat: You could do both things,False
"spryHorse: Considering both sides, the parents could make an effort to learn German, but that puts them in the same boat as the husband who has learned English as a 2nd language. Doesn't it?",False
newBear: likelyRhino - I agree,False
"spryRabbit: Common ground: just tell the mother he's not comfortable and ask if it's ok to speak German to him, be a translator and maybe when he is comfortable he will try to open up more.",False
likelyGiraffe: we're now at my mother's house,False
conventionalHippo: I think he has the right to choose the language that best suits his adult relationship. She needs to accept that and he can translate later,False
likelyGiraffe: really,False
snappyGoat: It can be translated immediately.,False
likelyGiraffe: really,False
conventionalHippo: yes. It can be translated immediately ,False
likelyRhino: They should just sit together and hash it out or just rent an apartment temporarily to avoid all this tension.,False
"sprySquirrel: I think he can doa  mix of both, ask the mom a question and if the husband is there, say something to him in German... Back to the mother, and so on",False
spryHorse: The daughter is the key to this whole thing though. She is fluent in both languages. She and her husband really should accomodate their hosts - the parents.,False
"snappyGoat: I think this is very rude to the mother, and unfair.",False
conventionalHippo: I think hashing it out is the best. Find the root of the problems and try and find realistic solutions. ,False
"likelyRhino: Yes, the daughter is an asshole for being disrespectful to her mom where she is staying at.",False
sprySquirrel: So I think the person is an asshole for choosing one side over the other in this circumnstance.,False
"snappyGoat: Yes, the daughter is an asshole. She can speak both languages, or she can translate. The husband should be understanding of this. Or they can stay elsewhere",False
sprySquirrel: I voted Yes.,False
culturedRhino: This couple could speak French in private.,False
youngHippo: I'm considering the fact that it's the mother's house and the son and his partner should be speaking English when she's there,False
"conventionalBear: Everyone speaks English. The mother does not speak French. They are speaking French in front of her, and being extremely rude. The mother is not an asshole.",False
"smallGorilla: I think the son and partner did not have malicious intentions, they were just creatures of habit and speaking a language that they normally speak with. The mother is taking it as if they were talking about her.",False
spryMonkey: agreed. If they can both speak English than I think they should respect the mom in her home,False
"snappyPig: If the mother did ask nicely to speak English then that should be that. The partner speaks English with an accent, there is nothing said about him not being comfortable to speak it.",False
"likelyHorse: My son’s partner is French, but he can speak English,",False
likelyOrangutan: The speaker isn't an asshole for wantiing to understand the conversation going on in front of her. The asshole is the husband of her son who has turned this into a competition of affection between him and his in-laws.,False
culturedRhino: I agree since he can speak English it should be spoken around Mom.,False
"snappyPig: If it was a private conversation between the son and partner, it can be talked about later.",False
likelyHorse: he just has an accent.,False
youngHippo: The mother is not an asshole!,False
likelyHorse: My son told me that I was making big deal out of nothing and making everyone feel awkward.,False
spryMonkey: But the mother did ask and they walked away. I think they were being disrespectful even if it wasn't intentional. ,False
"conventionalBear: It isn't even an important part of the story in this case, but they are also staying at her house.",False
"youngHippo: She has a right to politely ask, it may have an awkward in how she said it or whatever, but the idea behind it is OK. ",False
spryMonkey: Walking away was rude,False
likelyHorse: helping one,False
"culturedRhino: Mom can feel like she is beging spoken about, as the host she is being disrespected.  It would be different if the partner could not speak english.",False
smallGorilla: The son walked away might be because he felt the mother did not like him or something that upset him so he decided to leave the area and cool off.,False
"conventionalBear: Exactly, she has a right to say something if she is being disrespected like that.",False
likelyOrangutan: I agree they were both being disrespectful fo the mother. The husband is the asshole here. And the son is supporting his husband's disrespectful actions.,False
culturedRhino: I do think walking away was rude.,False
conventionalBear: and she even said something in a polite way.,False
"spryMonkey: How?! Instead of addressing the situation, he walked away. He was in wrong in the beginning and walked away so he wouldn't have to face the topic",False
likelyOrangutan: Yes I agree. both were rude to leave her there. It's definitely the husband who is trying to make a competition of affection the son.,False
"culturedRhino: I suppose that does cast some shade.  But, not enough to be disrespected. ",False
conventionalBear: I see absolutely nothing here that says the mom is an asshole.,False
"smallGorilla: The mother is not an asshole because she was voicing her opinion and expressing how she felt, they might have just taken it offesnively.",False
"youngHippo: It's legitimate to switch to a universal language - they are allowed to say some stuff in French, and of course in private, but in this case in the living room, they should been a little more inclusive, even 50%-50% would've been OK",False
spryMonkey: It could be miscommunication in how expectations were met,False
culturedRhino: As mom claimes she was nice about it she is not really the ass hole. ,False
"culturedRhino: Yes, it could be a miscommunication so perhaps a discussion should happen,  But that does not make her an ass hole. ",False
"conventionalBear: I disagree with the 50-50, at least when they are all sitting together. All 3 speak English well. ",False
likelyOrangutan: After considering all sides the blame lies primarily with the husband's rude behavior and the son supporting that behavior toward his mother. She was not an asshole to ask to understand English that both these men could easily speak .,False
spryMonkey: I still don't think she was the asshole here. At all,False

"conventionalCow: i agree , i think there are more problems then just the speaking issue",False

"culturedWolf: i agree, my parents are older and they struggle with learning the english language as well",False

newHorse: I don't think the son in law is an asshole for wanting someone to be more independent. but I know it can be harder for someone to learn another language,True
littleGoat: If this guy doesn't want to help he doesn't have to but he should be more respectful of his relatives.,False
"newBear: the fact that she reaches out to him and he's ""annoyed"" helping her really rubbed me the wrong way.",False
niceHippo: I've been to other countries and not been welcomed because i couldn't speak their language,False
newHorse: sounds like hes been helping for 8 years,True
conventionalCow: I think she was just wanting to spend time with him as well since she is his mother in law,False
littleGoat: Thats true niceHippo but this guy married into a Spanish speaking family. Different from just visiting a country.,False
"culturedWolf: I can understand how he can get frustrated with being the translator for that long, but I mean he knew what he was going into and he can't expect her to learn a new language fast enough like he did",False
conventionalCow: He should of been more considerate considering he knew that,False
newBear: is there a limit on helping family members when it is something you can easily do?,False
littleGoat: There's a lot more to the story. Maybe she is demanding. Maybe he is just an asshole. But he sounds passive-aggressive and I vote for asshole.,False

"niceOrangutan: I think he could have pushed back on helping as much in a different way, one that didn't offend her.",False
"niceHippo: Yeah, maybe he should have thought about that",False
conventionalCow: He could of even explained to his wife about this and maybe she could of explained better,False
newHorse: true,True
culturedWolf: that is true,False
newBear: I would agree with what someone said. The mother-in-law could be really needy and demanding.,False
littleGoat: He needs to be nicer to his mother in law. Or just avoid her. But don't be rude to her.,False

culturedWolf: yeah he did,False
littleGoat: Some people are never able to learn a new language though. Especially when older.,False

niceOrangutan: the bad attitude is apparent throughout his whole write-up.,False

niceRabbit: I don't think anyone is the asshole here.,False
smallHorse: Agreed; I don't think she's the asshole. I don't think her expectations are unreasonable.,False
culturedDonkey: no assholes,False
youngGiraffe: I do think it should be the actual daughter that has more of hand in helping her mother.,False
newRhino: that i agree with!,False
"niceRabbit: The guy isn't refusing, he's just getting tired of being the only translator",False
smallHorse: She seems like she's really busy - a full time job and full-time school.,False
niceRabbit: And I think the wife has a bit of an attitude about the whole thing,False
youngGiraffe: agreed,False
smallGorilla: they should share the responsibility ,False
"niceRabbit: Yes, share it!",False
culturedDonkey: the wife seems to have lots of attitude,False
"culturedBison: agreed , the daughter should of been helping out more , especially with her remark of why cant he take 10 minutes out of his day",False
smallGorilla: wifey does seem to have an attitude like. id id it my whole life now its my husbands turn,False
"smallHorse: if he is more available, then I understand why it more often falls to him.",False
newRhino: i think she is sort of being a hypocrite though because she claims it only takes 10 minutes out of his time but they are both as busy,False
niceRabbit: The parents are not going to learn English at this point,False
culturedBison: She could of helped her parents learn,False
culturedBison: I feel like she could of worked with him to handle this better. instead of leaving him to handle all of it.,False
"niceRabbit: Agreed, she should have helped",False
smallHorse: I don't think she was being unreasonable.,False
"niceRabbit: I think he is a decent guy, he is just tired of being the translator all the time.",False
smallHorse: The guy never re-directed the calls back to her...,False
"niceRabbit: True, he could have handled it different. But he's not an asshole, just maybe could handle it differently",False
culturedBison: he could of done that but at the same time if it kept happening over and over the daughter could of stepped in and spoke to her mom about it,False
smallHorse: I don't think they are communicating well between each other,False
"smallHorse: She didn't understand how he really feels about it, but its not her fault, because he clearly didn't communicate them well.",False

culturedBison: same,False
niceRabbit: Not from me,False
"conventionalRabbit: I do not think this person is the asshole, though I do think she shouldn't always pass the phone to her spouse. I think she needs to explain to him she is extremely stressed out and appreciates his help. ",False
snappySquirrel: I think the person is the asshole. It's not fair to inconvenience the husband. The parents can try to start some classes and work to improve English. I think the husband can offer a little time but not drop what he is doing all the time.,False
"snappyRhino: I don't think the person is an asshole for wanting to help their parents, but I do think she is an asshole for making her husband take on all the duties. They are her parents, not his. She should ask him first.",False
"spryLion: I don't think she is an asshole for expecting her husband to help out  a bit. Especially with the husband's handling of the situation, However I do think having to constantly have this responsibility of helping your SO's parents is unfair.",False
"culturedPig: My initial impression was that the wife was the asshole. After continuing to read, I found some of the comments made by the husband to make him the asshole. I do agree that she should probably talk to her mother about it.",False
conventionalWolf: I think that this person is being one but so is her husband.  This is something that they should have talked about way before she told him to start doing this.  I think that in the future she should still ask him but not as much. ,False
niceHippo: My initial thought is that he should be willing to help since he did marry into her family. Then you can think that she put her mom off on him because she got tired of it. Her parents should take the initiative to learn English. ,False
"spryDonkey: I do think they are an asshole.  Why do they make fun of him for being a ""gringo""?  Does he make fun of them for being hispanic?  I doubt it - that would be racist.  ",False
culturedPig: I think that the mother should ask both parties to translate. If the wife is there she should take care of it. ,False
"conventionalRabbit: His comments make him out to be a bigger asshole than she is for handing the phone over,  but it sounds like everyone is a bit stressed and not expressing feelings about the conversations.",False
"spryLion: Also, I am assuming this is somewhat present day, there are alot of translating tools on the internet today. She needs to setup these tools for her parents so they are not constantly calling for help.",False
culturedPig: I agree that they aren't both expressing their feelings. I also think perhaps talking to the mother could help. ,False
"snappyRhino: I agree that the parents need to do a little more, they have more tools than OP and her husband. But OP needs to talk to her husband.",False
"conventionalRabbit: Yes, I agree that bringing in the parents and giving them resources to use at home would be very helpful. ",False
spryDonkey: Why can't her parents learn to speak English in all the time they've been here?  My grandparents came from Italy and learned to speak English - so why can't hispanics do that?,False
culturedPig: That is not the topic at hand at the moment,False
conventionalWolf: I think that the problem is that they are surrounded by spanish speakers and have no reason to learn.  Especially if the daughter translates,False
"snappyRhino: Yeah, it's not about the parents, it's about OP expecting her husband to take on all the labor of translating.",False
spryDonkey: Like spryLion said there are lots of tools out there to learn English - why rely on someone else all the time?  Help yourself and learn to speak the language in the country that you're living in,False
culturedPig: I think that the husband is the asshole based on his comments and his unwillingness to help his wife and her family. I doubt it is an everyday occurrence ,False
niceHippo: This is something that they should sit down and talk about together. Maybe the daughter could try teaching her parents English herself since she thinks that its a privilege. ,False
conventionalRabbit: I think she just needs to be honest with her husband about her school and workload and express she really appreciates his help. She should also try to not always use him as the translator but step in when she can. ,False
spryDonkey: You live in America - you learn to speak English!  If I moved to Spain I would learn to speak Spanish,False
snappySquirrel: I think the wife shouldn't automatically assume that her husband can help out whenever. The husband should set boundaries.,False
"spryLion: I believe she is somewhat an asshole in this, but hey are bot going about this the wron way",False
snappySquirrel: The wife isn't being fair and thinking about resources like Google Translate to help her parents.,False
conventionalWolf: I would love to see you move to another country and learn the language fluently.  Lol it's so hard.,False
spryPig: I do not think he is an asshole. Remember he stated he was polite when bringing up the issue to his MIL. He is just venting on the reddit post.,False
"likelyRabbit: His attitude is what makes him seem like an asshole to me. I get that he's frustrated, but learning new languages isn't easy for everyone.",False
spryGoat: My initial thought was this guy was being a bit petty. Is it that difficult to have a quick conversation with a family member when they need help? It isn't always so easy to learn a new language later in life. ,False
littleDonkey: I don't think the husband is the asshole. He's not nice at what he's writing but he says he acts politely and offers resources for them to help themselves.,False
"spryCow: Wow!  What a pile of garbage this guy is.  Who yells at his in-laws like that?  He comes across as a real good guy, bragging about how smart he is because he took a couple of free internet programs.",False
nicePanda: Some elder members of families like that just won't learn the language and it's not up to the husband to decide.,False
littleDonkey: I don't think his in-laws are respectful of his time.,False
spryCow: Acts politely?  He cursed at his in-laws.,False
"spryGoat: It never said he was super busy, I mean my dad calls me all the time with ridiculous stuff and I pick up.",False
"spryPig: However, their MIL families reaction to instantly call him a racist is unfair. Espcially when he clearly took the time to learn Spanish and has helped his MIL plenty of time",False
smallWolf: I don't think he's an asshole at all I think his family is full of them though.  I don't think it's white privlege to speak English in America,False
nicePanda: I don't know if I believe him when he says that he brought it up in a calm and respectful way.,False
spryPig: where they just expect him to be there to help whenever the MIL says so,False
spryPig: it is unfair to him.,False
"likelyRabbit: Yeah, I understand that he's frustrated at what's happening, it seems like he wasn't asked to be the default translator. but his attitude isn't great.",False
likelyOrangutan: At first I thought he came off as cocky. But I do not think that he is after seeing that he was polite about it. He also said he would help her learn.,False
"spryGoat: His typing wasn't very calm, I have a hard time believing he was calm with the mother in law. ",False
smallWolf: Just more lazy hispanics that refuse to learn the language of the country they came to.,False
littleDonkey: Let's take racism out of it,False
spryGoat: We don't have a language. ,False
"spryCow: "". I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english, she's been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now, in comparison i taught myself spanish and portuguese""",False
littleDonkey: It's about assimilation into the country you live and being able to navigate the world,False
spryCow: This is why he sucks,False
"littleDonkey: If you immigrate, you should be expected to adapt certain languages and customs that are native to the country",False
spryCow: Are you guys real? ,False
"nicePanda: He didn't learn Spanish for the in laws specifically, the wife's post pointed out that he already knew Spanish. I don't think he should have a say in whether or not they learn English. ",False
"smallWolf: H learned to speak 3 languages in 3 years, yet they can't learn to speak English in the 8 years they've been here.  That's just lazy and pathetic!  Go back to where you came from",False
littleDonkey: I think he's trying to be helpful to his inlaws to empower them,False
spryPig: spryCow,False
spryCow: You speak 3 languages fluently?,False
spryGoat: It is extremely hard to learn a language when you are an adult. Kids' brains are much more adaptable.   ,False
"likelyRabbit: Learning a language can be easy for some people, but not everyone. ",False
spryPig: u miss quoted him,False
likelyOrangutan: It is unfair to him because he took initiative to learn another language he obviously felt was useful. They should do the same since they want someone to always translate.,False
spryPig: Read two words before your quote,False
littleDonkey: It's not about him in my opinion,False
smallWolf: littleDonkey is spot on!  Learn to assimilate to the country you moved to including learning basics like the language!,False
"spryPig: he said that is what he did not say, and that he was being polite on the phone",False
nicePanda: Some people want to keep their culture and that could be why they never wanted to learn. ,False
spryGoat: I wonder the ages of the parents too. Can they even use the links he sent? My own father can barely do Facebook and email. ,False
"spryPig: "" I'd also like to rephrase something, when explaining the situation to my MIL i didn't tell her ""I'm sick of dealing with your shit""""",False
littleDonkey: Yeah I imagine they are old,False
spryCow: I copied and pasted the quote.  I'm not misquoting anyone.,False
spryPig: Clearly missquited,False
spryPig: Legit three words before,False
nicePanda: Being an immigrant doesn't immediately mean that you adopt all of the customs of the culture you immigrate into. I think they should be allowed to speak whatever language they want. ,False
"smallWolf: I understand wanting to keep your culture, but there's no reason they can't learn the language of the country they came to live in.  My grandparents did it, so why can't they?",False
spryGoat: I dont think he should just expect elderly parents will know and be able to use what information he sent to help out. Again I cant imagine my parent being that much of a pain by helping them get through daily life.,False
likelyRabbit: I think he's an asshole because of his entitled attitude. He needs to talk to his wife and see if they can work something out together.,False
spryPig: Especially forcing someone else to be your translator at hand in any situation at any time,False
spryGoat: I guess he could just not answer the phone? ,False
spryCow: I think that he should not be the translator but he doesn't have to come across as arrogant.,False
smallWolf: lol spryGoat,False
littleDonkey: No one should be available 24/7 for something that can be outsourced with Google Translate,False
nicePanda: We were asked not to put personal scenarios into this. Your grandparents are irrelevant here. I think he is the asshole.,False
"spryPig: So instead, he politely brought up the issue to his MIL and they instantly go to calling him a racist and a Trump supporter",False
spryPig: they are defiantly not assholes at all. And not entitled immigrants themselves.,False
spryGoat: I question if he was really polite. He had to edit his original post as it was complete asshole talk,False
littleDonkey: No he is not the a-hole,False
spryPig: Yes because he his venting in a reddit post,False
spryPig: you have to remember that,False
spryCow: I say yes but only because of the way he acted,False

youngBear: Hi!  I believe this woman is definitely the asshole here.  What do you guys think?,False
culturedPanda: I believe she is the asshole as well. ,False
"culturedDonkey: Yeah, if she really felt that uncomfortable she could have gone about it a better way.  ",False
"youngBear: While there is always ""my house, my rules"", this was just rude and unnecesary.  She was literally just being nosy.",False
spryCow: This person is not at fault. It is a perfectly reasonable request to speak a language that all understand. Everyone spoke English after all.,False
culturedDonkey: LIke pulling her son aside or talking with the parter and not being so aggressive about it,False
"culturedPanda: Definitely, she could have pulled her son aside and discussed her concerns with him individually.",False
youngBear: There was no reason to make everyone uncomfortable.  ,False
newHippo: I kind of felt like she wasn't an asshole.  I would want to be involved with my son and his partner and be part of the conversation. But I agree the way she handled it wasn't the smoothest.,False
"conventionalPig: I don't think she is an asshole , but she could have said it in a different way.",False
culturedPanda: She also may not understand that although her son's partner speaks English he may be more comfortable in his native tongue.,False
"culturedDonkey: I think if we have to pick one or the other, she would potentially be the asshole. ",False
"youngBear: If they wanted her to know what they were saying then they would have spoken in English.  They didn't, obviously.",False
"culturedDonkey: I don't think she's entitled to know what they're saying at all times, but it does seem a little rude to openly exclude her from any conversation.  ",False
youngBear: I speak privately to my partner and would do so in another language if I knew one.  Sometimes you just need to speak privately.  They could have done so in another room or at another time.,False
"spryCow: I lived in Greece for over 20 years, as my ex-wife was Greek and I have been in similar situations. The French person should have been more polite.",False
"culturedDonkey: However, the situation dependent on how she went about it, and just looking at that, I would agree she is the asshole ",False
"conventionalPig: well if they didn't want her to know, they should have waited til they were alone to say something.",False
newHippo: I guess it depends too on how long this had been going on.  Like if they just were speaking French the entire time they had been visiting and she just got tired of not being involved.,False
youngBear: I believe that the way she handled it made her the asshole.  By making it awkward and uncomfortable.,False
spryCow: There is a sort of protocol for this in countries in Europe. The majority language wins.,False
"conventionalPig: yes, you are right she should have approach this situation a different way.",False
newHippo: I agree youngBear,False
"culturedPanda: I see your point in they shouldn't have spoken in a language she didn't understand in front of her and that is rude. However, I do feel that there was a way she could have gone about it without making both of them uncomfortable.",False
spryCow: But the French guy should not have huffed out of the room.,False
culturedDonkey: Agreed that the way she handled it made her the asshole.  ,False
"culturedDonkey: I think that's what this situation is about, not anything that happened afterwards ",False
spryCow: Do not agree. She was justified. Her son was actually the asshole.,False
youngBear: So is anyone planning on not voting asshole?,False
"conventionalPig: the french guy should have said how he felt and not walked out, they should try to understand everyones view.",False
culturedPanda: Yes but the French guy is also only 20 years old,False
conventionalPig: not asshole ,False
spryCow: I will not vote that she was an asshole because it is not true,False
"conventionalPig: i also will not vote she is an asshole, because she is not.",False
snappyCow: So are they the asshole?,False
conventionalBison: He's an asshole. If he had no intention of conversing with his mother he should not have visited.,False
"conventionalGoat: No, he is not an asshole. He could have explained himself to his mother \",True
"snappyHippo: I'm really not sure how I feel in this situation.  I think both sides have valid points, however I think that making your partner comfortable is important?",False
niceWolf: Obviously very similar to the first scenario.  I feel he is being an asshole by not including his mother.  ,False
"spryLion: This is more difficult to decide from the point of view of the person who is just stuck in the middle and trying to please everyone.  I would be inclined to say that he's not an asshole, he's just in a difficult situation.",True
conventionalGoat: he should however include her because they are in her house ,True
"snappyHippo: Also, it wasn't mentioned that he wasn't talking to her at all. ",False
"conventionalBison: Of course the partner should be comfortable, but he has to make accomodations if he is going to visit the mother.",False
"snappyCow: I think making your partner comfortable is important but in this scenario, I think the poster is the asshole.",False
"spryLion: He's trying to keep his husband happy and comfortable.  He doesn't want to be excluding his mother, but doesn't know what to do.  His intentions are good.",True
niceWolf: I agree snappyCow,False
conventionalGoat: I am on the same page as you spryLion,True
"conventionalBison: After all, that's why they have come - for her.",False
niceWolf: The husband speaks English I believe it said but just that he feels silly when he cannot think of the correct word.  I would guess that the mother wouldn't make fun of her son's partner for this.,False
snappyCow: The intentions while good are a little misguided as they are making the mother uncomfortable in her home even after the mother brought it to her attention politely.,False
conventionalBison: I have been in this situation before. Sometimes visiting inlaws is uncomfortable but you make an extra effort.,False
snappyHippo: I feel like both have valid points.  ,False
snappyHippo: I guess maybe the son is the asshole here.  Perhaps the partner could make more of an effort?  ,False
"snappyHippo: Yes, conventionalBison I agree",False
niceWolf: I agree with that snappyHippo,False
conventionalGoat: they could all try something. the boyfriend should try to speak English sometimes and the son translate sometime and the mother should know to let them have their own conversation,True
snappyHippo: It just feels like no one is outwardly a huge asshole here but I guess we have to choose.  ,False
conventionalBison: I agree too. Poster is asshole - although there are nuances.,False
snappyCow: I agree with snappyHippo as well. ,False
spryLion: I could go either way.  I don't feel strongly.  ,True
niceWolf: Yeah just seems like they need to sit down and communicate and let each other know how they are feeling and figure it out.,False
snappyCow: Exactly nic,False
conventionalBison: The only way they can do that is in English.,False
niceWolf: Good point.,False
"spryLion: Haha, true conventionalBison",True
conventionalBison: I think we are agreed here.,False
"snappyHippo: Okay, I have my answer.  ",False

culturedRhino: Speaking a language does not make you an asshole,False
"youngDonkey: I have a lot of friends who have family and spouses that speak different languages. I think its a tricky thing,  but its important for everyone to be patient when another language is being spoken",False
youngDonkey: I don't think the woman is an asshole,False
likelyBear: I don't think either of them is the asshole. I think that should be an option. The mother hasn't seen her daughter and wants to interact with her. She doesn't know German. The daughter wants to make her significant other comfortable. ,False
culturedRhino: The mother is an asshole for not understanding,False
conventionalRabbit: I think they should have spoken in English.,False
conventionalRabbit: They went to meet their mother only for the weekend. ,False
culturedRhino: The mother should learn German; while the husband should learn English.,False

"likelyBear: No one is too old to learn anything, but the husband doesn't necessarily have to speak. ",False
newPig: The mother and daugher go off on their own for a period of time to catch up if thats what he mother wants.,False
likelyBear: Or he can speak german and his spouse can translate.,False
spryOrangutan: good idea,False
conventionalRabbit: Husband can speak little English.,False
spryOrangutan: husband can eat meals,False
"conventionalRabbit: As a respect for mother, they should have conversed with her in English.",False
"snappyBison: I think conversing with one another should be in a language they are most comfortable with.  Perhaps ""mom"" can learn some German if ""hubby"" should learn English?",False
likelyBear: The OP has a lot of time with the spouse. If they're in a separate bedroom or something they can speak German but if they're in a common area it doesn't seem right to exclude the mother. ,False

likelyBear: If we have to choose a side I'd say that the OP is the one who needs to implement some changes. ,False
conventionalRabbit: That is why she is an asshole. She should have balanced both sides.,False
likelyBear: It's a tricky situation though.,False

niceMonkey: She is slightly an asshole for implacing judgement onto others,False
likelyCow: I think the son is doing wrong,False
conventionalPanda: This one seems really similar to Round 1 but in Round 1 I voted the opposite way. I think the mother is the asshole here. She isn't the asshole because she feels left out but the way she brought it up was kind of mean. ,False
likelyCow: She politely told them to talk in English,False
"likelyHippo: I dont believe mom is being an asshole here, she wants to be involved and she is interested in them.  She wants to feel included and there is nothing wrong with that.",False
spryGiraffe: Overall I believe it is alright for the parents to ask for help once in a while.i ,False
niceMonkey: I am honestly 50/50.,False
conventionalPanda: Telling your son and his partner that they're being disrespectful isn't polite. ,False
likelyCow: I also favor mom,False
spryGiraffe: The boys can talk French in the bedroom,False
niceMonkey: I agree spryGiraffe she should be able to communicate with son,False
spryGiraffe: Mom is always right...jk,False
likelyCow: Yes they should talk common language in group,False
conventionalPanda: They can talk French in the bedroom but there's a nicer way to let them know. ,False

likelyHippo: They they are in her house and they can be respectful of her while she is putting them up and providing a place for them while they visit.,False
conventionalPanda: I think she's the asshole because of the way she addressed it,False
likelyCow: and the husband should not get up and go,False
spryGiraffe: How would you like your child doing this to you?,False
niceRhino: Yeah the husband shouldn't have reacted that way,False
likelyCow: very disrespectful,False
niceMonkey: lol,False
conventionalPanda: If I was the mother in that situation I would speak to my son separately about it. ,False
likelyCow: same here,False
niceMonkey: are y'all real tho?,False
conventionalPanda: Let him know that I'd like to be included in the conversation too and have him talk to his partner about it,False

conventionalPanda: and I think that's what makes the OP the asshole,False
likelyCow: but they should have respected mother,False
conventionalPanda: From their standpoint they weren't being disrespectful ,False
likelyCow: you do not become small in speaking in a language that is understood by all,False
likelyHippo: The son is used to ignoring his mom so it wasnt an issue for him most likely.,False
conventionalPanda: If the mother talked to her son separately and then he got upset and continued to only speak in French then the OP wouldn't be the asshole,False
likelyCow: private discussion in bedroom,False
conventionalPanda: but I think the way she dealt with it makes her the asshole ,False

niceRhino: I think the approach was a bit asshole-ish,False
conventionalPanda: They're only visiting for a week,False
conventionalPanda: They're guests in her home,False
spryGiraffe: The mom is not an asshole. She is being left out. The boys could keep quiet or speak Fench in the bedroom or an alternate private area.,False
conventionalPanda: and she make her son's partner feel bad ,False
"likelyBear: I think he is not an asshole. No way. Think about it from his shoe, it would get really annoying. Plus he was polite about it and he gave her the resources to do it like duolingo. ",False
"likelyBear: (My Last Sentence) He also helped her for a while, and he gave her lots of time to learn English and also was giving her support to learn English.",False
"littleRabbit: I don't think he's the asshole either, he has been helpful, and I can see how it would get obnoxious. ",False
culturedGoat: I am torn because he says he was polite to his mother-in-law yet is not polite at all in what he writes.  Familes ask ech other to do things for each other.  That can get annoying but families annoy each other all the time.,False
"littleRabbit: This is true, his tone is super rude and condescending. ",False
littleRabbit: It makes the decision difficult.,False
smallOrangutan: I think he was the asshole.  The mother in law was  made to feel like a burden. The feelings of being put out were very apparent in his post and can come through no matter how polite you are.   ,False
littleRabbit: Now I am torn!,False
"culturedGoat: Yes I agree with you.  He thinks he is being nice, but he isn't.",False
"spryDonkey: This was a bit of a tossup for me but I'm going with he is the asshole. The way he wrote his post doesn't sound to me like he was being very polite about it, especially the sentence he wrote in his ""Edit"".",False
"smallOrangutan: that being said, i think if he had talked to his wife first and discussed out to approach his mother in law with this, it might have gone smoother",False
culturedGoat: I feel as if he is just making excuses for poor behavior.,False
likelyBear: we got 2 minutes guys,False
likelyBear: i dont think he is an asshole,False
culturedGoat: I think he is an asshole.,False
likelyBear: who agrees and disagrees,False

spryDonkey: I think he was an asshole.,False
"smallOrangutan: asshole, this could have been handled better",False
culturedGoat: yes  ass hole,False
likelyBear: asshole,False
culturedWolf: I don't think she is the asshole. ,False
"culturedWolf: I get her husband being annoyed, but at the same time he is part of the family and it's not that hard to help out. ",False
culturedWolf: I would want my husband to do the same thing. ,False
snappyHippo: This is difficult because she refers to her husband as a gringo and expects him to help a lot.  Her family has been in the country quite a while.,False
"culturedRhino: i am a litle back and forth on this one,  The wife is not respecting her husband feelings on the matter",False
"snappyHippo: How much time is involved here?  She says not very much, but the husband feels it is a lot a time.",False
culturedSquirrel: The husbands is gotta step up to the plate. Thats family plus he is not even busy. It takes 10 minutes. She is not an asshole,False
"littleHorse: Tough one, but I don't think she was the asshole for asking him to help translate every once in awhile. But calling him a ""gringo"" and not considering his feelings is a little asshole-ish on her part as well.",False
culturedSquirrel: Thats a reasonable thing to ask from your husband like what,False
"culturedRhino: But, the husband does have more time to help out the mother in law.  Anew language is hard,  and for older people changing their thought proccess is difficult",False
culturedRhino: This family needs to sit down and talk. ,False
snappyHippo: It is hard to learn a language but it sounds as if the entire family has been here for many years.,False
snappyHippo: perhaps there is another family member who could help with translations.,False
culturedRhino: im going with not the asshole.  But the husband does need to have his feelings respected and acknowledged ,False
culturedSquirrel: yea what we feeling guys,False
culturedSquirrel: i say no asshole,False
littleHorse: Leaning towards not the asshole,False
snappyHippo: I guess no but a new plan has to be made to help the mother.,False
culturedSquirrel: Facts,False
culturedSquirrel: but lowkey esl classes is good,False
culturedSquirrel: like she acts like she is the only immigrant who doesnt know english in america. so many people come over and learn english,False
culturedRhino: or help the mother in law find a friend or companion to help out with everyday issues in translation ,False
smallHorse: I don't think the writer is an asshole,False
newHippo: My initial impression is he is indeed the ass hole.  Just because one person can learn multiple languages does not mean everyone can with that kind of ease.  Also clearly she is older and we should be respecting our elders. ,False
newMonkey: I understand how this could become very annoying. I think he did the right thing. He even offered sources and to help.,False
smallHorse: If his life is being consumed by having to translate all the time then he has a right to make that request,False
youngSquirrel: This guy should have understood the family dynamic when he married in. It is obvious the family takes the position of taking care of the MIL.,False
conventionalGoat: My thoughts are that he was not the asshole. I thought that he was just frustrated. It seems he has been helping her for a while. Its a shame everyone is mad at him. ,False
"newHippo: He knew all of these facts when he married his wife, and was accepting of them.  Sure it may be annoying, but we do things we don't necessarily want to for family.",False
newMonkey: isn't helping her to learn a way of taking care of her?,False
newHippo: He lashed out in frustration and that makes him the asshole.,False
youngSquirrel: Not everyone is good at languages. The older you get the harder it is.,False
"snappyBear: I'm having trouble deciding, but I'm feeling like he is a bit of an asshole for simply making his mother-in-law feel lesser, even if his intentions were good.",False
"newHippo: Proposing it slowly over time in a calm, and respectful manner with the support of his wife, since it is her family would have potentially solved the issue.",False
newMonkey: but isn't 8 years long enough to at least learn basic English,False
conventionalGoat: Maybe he did lash out. I can see where that would hurt his mother-in-law. ,False
"smallHorse: Personally I wouldn't want to have to ask someone to take me everywhere, I think she enjoys being catered to",False
youngSquirrel: Not if that was never the intention. He is projecting his desires.,False
"conventionalGoat: Also, we all sometimes need help from family. ",False
newMonkey: he even said he was respectful when telling her,False
snappyBear: I don't really think that it was the author's place to tell this to his mother in law. Let it come from someone she would relate to better so it doesn't sound so biased.,False
"smallHorse: I see what you are saying, but if it's not his place to tell her, why is it his place to babysit her?",False
"youngSquirrel: By his language, I doubt he is respectful IRL.",False
newMonkey: exactly,False
newHippo: As the only white person in the scenario it does come off as entitled and like he expected everyone to assimilate ,False
newMonkey: possibly but maybe he was venting,False
snappyBear: I think he could have chosen a better way to ask her to stop calling on him all the time and to be more self-sufficient,False
"smallHorse: That would be my only question, was he REALLY respectful in person, because in the text he did sound like an asshole.",False
newMonkey: true,False
youngSquirrel: There is a cultural aspect here that I think he is missing.,False
"snappyBear: I agree that from the way the post was written, it's hard to imagine the conversation being too polite and sensitive.",False
conventionalGoat: Ok. I guess he's the asshole. ,False
"smallHorse: It could be that to, I think Latino people are more family oriented",False
newHippo: The way he mentioned learning the language of the country then acknowledging we don't have an official language makes me feel he was disrespectful,False
smallSquirrel: This one could really go both ways,False
"littleWolf: I think no one is the ass hole.  I think this boils down to cultural differences.  Latinx families are very interwoven and tight knit, and do everything and anything for each other.",False
"niceHorse: The family established their dynamic long before this husband came around, he knew what it was when he married in.",False
"spryPig: My initial impression is that it could go both ways, I get both sides. ",False
"littleWolf: So one husband who was raised in the culture and one who was not, have differences of opinions in this and differences in how they were raised.",False
"smallSquirrel: I think she should understand that it's not his responsibility, and shouldn't expect him to do it. That being said he knew what he was marrying in to.",False
smallOrangutan: This one's tough; I in a way I feel like the husband and wife are both a in the wrong and both in the right in different ways.,False
conventionalBison: They make fun of him but expect him to translate for them. He's the AH,False
conventionalBison: No. I mean she is.. ...,False
"niceHorse: There should be ground rules of when he can help. But since wife works more than him, he should help.",False
spryPig: why should he translate though if they make fun of him,False
littleWolf: I feel like there just needs to be an open and honest conversation between the couple about what is expected.,False
"smallSquirrel: Yeah that is true, she did say they make fun of him a lot.",False
smallOrangutan: I agree it boils down to cultural differences in a lot of ways. And probably some generational differences too.,False
smallSquirrel: I think she's an asshole for not having the conversation with her husband and her mother and instead posting about it on the internet.,False
conventionalBison: It also seems like he is telling her that he is frustrtrated and had enough. She is minimizing his concerns. ,False
smallOrangutan: Moving toward resolution rather than placing blame would probably be the better move.,False
spryPig: she should have asked him if he minded in the first place,False
"smallSquirrel: Kudos to her for getting her master's an being busy, but that doesn't make her mother his responsibility. I'm sure he's got a life too.",False
conventionalBison: I hate it when other people tell me what I have time for....,False
spryPig: me too,False
"niceHorse: of course, compromise is marriage, so there should be boundaries and communication. But much of that was before marriage stuff. He's in it now.",False
littleWolf: I feel like no one is the ass hole though I feel like it was a miscommunication in expectations,False
conventionalBison: I feel bad for the guy and I almost never feel bad for the guy.,False
"smallOrangutan: But now that it's boiling over, I'm inclined to say both are being assholes if they can't find a solution/compromise.",False
spryPig: she shouldn't make fun if him and expect him to do the thing they make fun of him foir,False
"niceHorse: Since the family took it on themselves to take care of the mother, it isn't fair for the husband to come in and expect them to all change.",False
spryPig: She shouldn't expect his help with something hes made fun of for.,False
"smallSquirrel: I see what you are saying, but if they all take care of the mother and were doing it before he came along, why is it now all on his shoulders?",False
youngCow: I do not think this man is the asshole. I think he is being taking advantage of in a situation where the mom and family could have helped themselves instead of relying on others around them. ,False
littlePanda: I feel like there is a cultural component in play. The fact that the mother in law was calling him actually seems like he is accepted/respected in the family.,False
"youngPig: thought he was the asshole until I read the edit. I think the racism, trump supporter comments have nothing to do with anything. Probably be best to offer other ways to translate like their phone. This would take the burden off him.",False
"conventionalSquirrel: I really consider this guy to be the asshole in this situation. I understand that he has a good mind for learning languages and I understand that having to act like a translator may be uncomfortable, but ultimately he could have expressed",False
conventionalSquirrel: Himself in a healthy way,False
littlePanda: I think he could of handled it better.,False
spryRhino: I don't think this person is wrong for wanting to help his mother in law. He made a strong case for why she needs to learn english. I feel like the family jumped to conclusions  about his motives.,False
"conventionalRabbit: This guy is an asshole. His writing was very combative, so even though he said he was polite when talking to her, the way he described it came across as angry and mean",False
"littlePanda: I agree and honestly if he is busy, then just don't pick up the phone!",False
"youngPig: well he is angry, hes sick of being on call as a translator",False
"youngCow: I do not think he minds helping and translating, but it’s the fact that it happens now several times a day and has become excessive",False
newDonkey: I don't blame him,False
youngPig: lack of understanding for the other can be extremely frustrating ,False
youngPig: from the others*,False
"littlePanda: So, probably needs better boundries but, don't think he handled it the best way.",False
newDonkey: She should at try to learn some English ,False
conventionalRabbit: It’s his mother in law. He should be more understanding of her situation. ,False
"youngPig: there is middle ground, can show them how to use their smart phone to translate, so he doesnthave to do it ALL the time",False
newDonkey: He should help her learn ,False
youngCow: He may not have handled it the best but I can understand the frustration that builds up over time,False
conventionalRabbit: Why not enroll the whole family in a class? Or if they have a young kid maybe they can learn to read together,False
"youngPig: he offered to help them learn, they dont want to take the time",False
"littlePanda: In some parts of CA, Spanish is practically the other accepted language. I can see how you may be able to get by without learning over the 8 years",False
youngPig: which is fine they dont need to its not a requirment,False
spryRhino: All members of the family need to come to an understanding and also try to figure out why he seems to be the one left to be an interpreter. ,False
conventionalSquirrel: I’m sure she has tried to learn some English. Americans are very derogatory in general to people with less than perfect English. I’m sure it’s intimidating to be met with meanness when she tries to use English,False
youngPig: but that is their choice and they have to live with that choice. he should have a say on his own involvement though,False
"newDonkey: Yeah,  I would be frustrated to if I had to be called on to  constantly translate ",False
littlePanda: He does... nto answering the phone,False
littlePanda: not*,False
"smallMonkey: if he was respectful, they should all be appreciative that he's trying to help",False
youngCow: I don’t think this man hates having to translate but maybe wants it to be less frequent through out the day. ,False
"newDonkey: No, i",False
"spryRhino: I agree, he does ahave a choice regarding his own involvement .",False
youngCow: He didn’t convey it in such a way though,False
"littlePanda: I feel like the way he handled it is leaning ""asshole"", but that doesn't make him a bad person.",False
"newDonkey: I don't think hes an asshole, he should buy her one of those translator devices ",False
"conventionalRabbit: This guy let his emotions get the best of him and he could have been respectful. He is the asshole, but it could have been avoided if he thought out his words before speaking",False
youngPig: the edit explained he was nicer about it,False
"conventionalSquirrel: He is the asshole ultimately. He shouldn’t have exploded. If everyone in his family and her family is not on his side, that points out that he may be the asshole",False
"youngPig: he didnt, he only exploded in the story not in person",False
"spryGoat: its nice to volunteer your own time for other people, not so much when you volunteer someone elses time for them without asking",False
"likelySquirrel: I think she should not have expected her husband to do it without asking, but I don’t think it is an entirely unreasonable thing to want ",False
niceLion: I don't  think she should put this off on her hubby ,False
likelySquirrel: They need better communication between them,False
"likelyWolf: Grad school is hard and definitely can be tough on a spouse... but, I would hope the Husband would be a little more supportive",False
spryBear: I’m on the fence on this one. This man married into this marriage knowing he’d probably be translating ,False
"niceLion: Just like her time is precious, I'm sure his is too",False
smallOrangutan: i dont think shes ta. i think shes not really listening to him though and siding with her mother,False
spryBear: What’s TA?,False
"likelyWolf: I'm leaning ""not"", but seriously... getting a Master's degree can screw up a relationship",False
snappyMonkey: This man should be honored to have a family that welcomes him and he should be happy to help them in any way,False
likelySquirrel: TA = The asshole,False
spryBear: Thanks,False
smallOrangutan: ta = the asshole,False
"spryGoat: Can never expect someone else to do things without asking, and then to be mad at them when  they have done it without being asked but get tired of doing it. they didnt volunteer, you cant be made at someone for not volunteering",False
"niceLion: They need to get her a translator device, download the app and show her how to use it",False
spryGoat: mad*,False
"likelyWolf: He is her partner, though",False
newPig: This woman sounds self-invested and disrespectful to her husband. She has determined that his time is less valuable than hers. She should help her own moher and not volunteer him. She thinks that her own work matters more than his.,False
smallOrangutan: he was respectful and offered to help teach her with online courses,False
"spryGoat: yeah, i am married, i would have been asked, not volunteered, and i dont even wear the pants lol",False
"spryBear: Yes, you marry the family too, but I highly doubt he asked to be a translator for his MIL on a regular basis",False
snappyMonkey: He is her partner and learned Spanish so he could communicate with her family…,False
"likelySquirrel: It depends on his reasoning for being mad. If he’s mad for her volunteering him, she might be the asshole. If he’s mad because the mom should learn English, he’s the asshole.",False
likelyWolf: Agree,False
"likelyWolf: So, which one is it though?",False
niceLion: He shouldn't have to spend every min of his life translating for her mother ,False
"newPig: The husband is the partner, but he is not the fall guy. She should have asked him if he would be fine with helping her mother.",False
"spryGoat: in this case, she is, for volunteering him without asking",False
smallOrangutan: they should learn english. some european countries require to speak the native language fluently for citizenship,False
spryGoat: they could use phone translator,False
spryGoat: not even sure how this is a big deal at this point but its the scenerio,False
snappyMonkey: We don’t know if she asked him or not,False
"smallOrangutan: thats true too, i didnt think of translation apps",False
spryBear: I don’t think they necessarily need to learn English but there’s certainly lots of translator apps available that are easy to use. He could help her learn,False
niceLion: Shes selfish and doesn't consider how he feels  being joined at the hip with her mother as her personal translator ,False
"likelySquirrel: If he has enough time to answer the phone, he can do it. If he doesn’t want to he can just not answer the phone. Or he could set a boundary like no more than 3 times a week.",False
"likelyWolf: there is a tinge of white privelege in his stance, though...",False
"spryGoat: she didnt, she volunteered his time without askign according to the scenerio if i rmeember correctly",False
snappyMonkey: Passing something along implies she told him about it first,False
"newPig: After 8 years, I don't think the mother in law cares to learn English. ",False
niceLion: She shouldn't have volunteered him for the job without asking ,False
snappyMonkey: She dodmt,False
"likelyWolf: Different mother in law, isn't it?",False
snappyMonkey: Didn’t,False
"likelySquirrel: Maybe something he said made the wife think it was ok. Also, she implies that originally the mother asked her first and the mother chose to start calling the husband directly ",False
spryGoat: she gave him the phone because she was busy,False
spryGoat: it became a daily thing,False
snappyMonkey: An occasional thing,False
niceLion: 8 years is a long time to be in  the US and not know a lick of English ,False
"likelyWolf: Yeah, pretty sure it said occasionally",False
"spryBear: Occasionally I wouldn’t mind but if it’s daily, it would irritate me",False
"spryGoat: was occasional, then they called him directly",False
likelyWolf: Where is the 8 years coming from? Wasn't that the last one?,False
likelyOrangutan: Does anyone else think this person was the asshole?,False
"conventionalGorilla: I think the fact that the poster mentioned they asked politely which is a factor, so I don't think they're an asshole",False
"youngHippo: Yea this person is an asshole. You're in America. It's freedom of speech, whether you wanna speak English or not.",False
culturedHorse: I thought the son in law was actually insensitive to her not understanding French,False
conventionalGorilla: Agreed,False
"likelyOrangutan: Maybe, but if they wanted to speak English and include her they could have. Not everyone has to be part of every conversation. ",False
"youngLion: I personally think the person is an asshole, just because she doesn't understand doesn't mean she is entitled to know what they are talking about",False
smallRhino: They are free to speak what they want.,False
youngHippo: The person probably feels most comfortable speaking French. Now they feel super uncomfortable for speaking what they know best.,False
conventionalGorilla: I think because it's a son it makes it ruder to speak a language the poster doesn't understand.,False
conventionalGorilla: They can go to a private space to speak if they want to speak privately.,False
youngLion: I speak to my wife and there are alot of things that I don't want my parents to know ,False
conventionalGorilla: True,False
"culturedHorse: If you are speaking in front of another person and in their home as guests, it’s pretty much standard that you don’t exclude your host.",False
likelyOrangutan: But what if they were there before and she sat down? ,False
"culturedHorse:  Agree that she should not be privy to all their conversations but in front of her, yes",False
youngLion: I don't think the son is a guest in a home that is owned by his parent,False
conventionalGorilla: Let's all think about how we would feel if our parents/children/family did this while staying at our house... I would be upset too.,False
culturedBear: Yeah he's an asshole. I Especially as guests in her home they should include her in all public conversations,False
newGoat: I do not think that this person was wrong at all. She does not understand the language in which they are speaking but they do speak and understand the language she is familiar with. ,False
"likelyOrangutan: Was she trying to have a conversation with them as well? If she's on her phone and otherwise disinterested, I don't see a problem in having a conversation in their own language.",False
culturedHorse: I would definitely feel hurt,False
culturedBear: As would i,False
smallRhino: I wouldn't be upset unless they were talking bad about me in the other language haha.,False
culturedHorse: But it is not the sons native language,False
"newGoat: Also, if the son has something to say to his spouse that he doesn't want his in law to hear than he should say it in private, not another language. ",False
youngHippo: She didn't have to say it was disrespectful. That's not a good word to tell someone. Just say you don't understand what's going on and would follow the conversation better if it was in English.,False
"likelyOrangutan: They are not guests. They are visiting family. When you visit family, do you act formal 100% of the time or do you chill and relax?",False
conventionalGorilla: I act formal.... ,False
"youngLion: She doesn't need to feel like she is entitle to anything from her kids, just because you have them as a guest doesn't mean you need to give them a 1to1 play by play of what you are saying",False
youngHippo: But yea it is her house and she has every right to act like a Karen.,False
culturedBear: It could be a matter of embatassment as weel,False
"youngLion: We assume that we are all perfect, but in reality we all do this, even if it is unintentional ",False
culturedHorse:  I if my children are in our home they know the rules of etiquette ,False
conventionalGorilla: So what do we all think? Asshole or not?,False
"newGoat: Yes, but it is rude to exclude someone in the same room from an open conversation. ",False
youngLion: Asshole,False
youngHippo: I vote asshole,False
likelyOrangutan: I still think asshole. ,False
culturedHorse: Not asshole,False
conventionalGorilla: Not asshole,False
smallRhino: I vote asshole.,False
culturedBear: Perhaps heI agree ashole,False
"newGoat: I'm sorry but I don't think she is an asshole, I think they are being insensitive to her. ",False
conventionalGorilla: 4 asshole/3 not; so majority vote for asshole?,False
newGoat: I would be hurt if my daughter did this. ,False
culturedHorse: I wonder if the tables were reversed if the husband would have been offended,False
likelyOrangutan: I think that is the best because we want to come to a consensus. ,False
youngHippo: Maybe she would prefer Spanish?,False
youngLion: Majority holds that she is an asshole,False

newHorse: Agreed.,False
"littleCow: I think that this person is considering both sides but is siding with his husband in the end, which is the right thing to do. ",False
newHorse: I think because the husband doesn't comfortably speak the language that the person is just trying to make the best of being between a rock and a hard place.,False
likelyHippo: The writer created afalsechoice forhimself. It wasn't either or,False
littleBison:      ,False
"niceWolf: I think the person is an asshole. They are visiting their mom, not the boyfriend so she should be speaking english. ",False
"newBear: I'm not sure, I think there's more to consider here. She came to visit her mom and spend time with her mom seeing as she lives part-time in both places. ",False
culturedOrangutan: he is looking at both sides and think that the mom would be understanding and accomidating to her son in law,False
littleBison:   agreed ,False
smallDonkey: I think she's an asshole because she is a guest.  She should include her mom in the conversation cause she never gets to see her.,False
likelyHippo: He's the asshole fornot explaining  before hand tomom,False
smallDonkey: Her husband will understand. Obviously her mom doesn't. But that's alright.,False
littleBison: On the other hand are just there for the weekend so maybe they could accommodate her but you are right they are ,False
newHorse: I think they could have explained to the mom a little better why they are choosing to speak German mostly.,False
"littleCow: The son's husband is not comfortable speaking English because he is not good at it, and probably afraid of saying the wrong thing to the mother in law. ",False
littleCow: This is just showing that the husband is also considerate. ,False
"niceWolf: Her boyfriend can still understand english, but the mom might not be able to understand german.",False
"culturedOrangutan: Plus since they live in 2 different countries, the husband is not comfortable of balancing 2 languages",False
littleBison: I think the mom could’ve been more ,False
likelyHippo: Making the effort is what matters,False
"littleCow: Yes, they should explain it to the mom, but she should be understanding to the situation at hand. ",False
newBear: I think it was the daughters job to be more open and forthcoming about it all though. ,False
newHorse: That's a good point likelyHippo,False
"culturedOrangutan: agreed, attempting to see both sides is not what an asshole would do",False
littleBison: ,False
"newBear: which I think is the reason that makes her the asshole specifically, not anyone else in that scenario. ",False
littleBison:   aren’t ,False
smallDonkey: I can see why she wouldn't want to upset her husband. But they're not in his country right now. She should respect her mom's wishes.,False

likelyHippo: Sort of....i agree about the lack offommunication,False
newHorse: Agreed; not an asshole,False
littleBison: Not  ,False

newBear: smallDonkey why do you think that?,False
culturedOrangutan: majority holds not asshole,False
likelyHippo: he should have talked to mom before hand and tried to get the partner to make an attempt,False
littleBison: Majority ,False
niceWolf: I still think the person is an asshole. If it was just some german it would be fine. But the person is only talking in that langauge.,False
smallDonkey: She's a guest at her mom's house and her mom doesn't understand the language. The very least she can do is speak English to her mom. She never gets to see her.,False
littleCow: small smallDonkey he clearly feels bad about the situation and in this case how is someone sensitive to other's feelings an asshole?,False

culturedOrangutan: do you want to continue to force someone who clearly can't help but not communicate effectively to make them speak a language they have trouble with?,False
"conventionalOrangutan: I think the person in question is an asshole.  Even though they are married, the husband shouldn't have to tend to the mother in law every time she has a translation question. ",False
conventionalLion: My initial reaction is the wife is dumping her parents off on her husband to solve their problems.,False
smallGiraffe: I think it's unreasonable for the person to ask her husband to help out all of the time. I understand occasionally but constantly is too much. ,False
niceBison: I think that she is an asshole because she should be willing to help some of the time. She should figure out something for her parents when they need help translating. ,False
niceBison: She could have asked one of her siblings to step up and help.,False
"conventionalOrangutan: I agree with the husband, that the wife's parents *should* have learned English.  Yes, you immigrated, and it's hard, but the parents are assholes too for burdening the wife and now the husband.",False
smallGoat: I was thinking since the wife is working full time and doing her Masters she has her  hands full and asking the husband to help her parents isnt that big a deal since they are married,False
newBear: Her being TA depends on how often her husband is having to do this and how long they have been in the country. If it has been a while then yes she is being TA.,False
"conventionalOrangutan: Once in a while is ok, but expecting it all the time whenever they call?  I don't think so.",False
niceBison: I think we all agree she is a TA,False
conventionalOrangutan: ^,False
"conventionalLion: I can see her point about having less free time because of work and school, but they are her parents. The guy has clearly been a good sport already helping out with the language barrier. It is fine for him to help sometimes, but not always.",False
"smallGiraffe: Just because he's married into the family doesn't mean he took on their responsibilities as well when he said ""I do""",False
conventionalLion: I agree that we are on the same page.,False
smallGoat: Agreed that it sounds like he is burnt out on helping her parents and that they should take iniitiatve to try and learn English,False
"conventionalOrangutan: Don't give someone a fish, teach them how to fish.",False
niceBison: She is being a TA saying her parents shouldn't have to learn English.,False
smallGiraffe: Exactly conventionalOrangutan,False
conventionalLion: Can we make any case for her side? I can't really see one besides she's has bitten on too much with work and school.,False
smallGoat: Older people can be set in their ways,False
niceBison: I can't sympathize for her at all. Her tone was TA from the beginning. ,False
"conventionalOrangutan: I don't think she has a case.  We all agree that once in a while helping out is cool, and it seems like the husband is already doing that.  Doesn't matter if older people are set in their ways, they're still being assholes.",False
smallGoat: It sounds like she is ambitious and that she has had a tough life and she's using her husbnd as a lifeline because she is overloaded,False
niceMonkey: The person in question is not an asshole.  It is not his responsibility to act as a translator for the family.,False
culturedRhino: I don't think he's an asshole. I think his feelings are completely valid and to the point where hes just being used and is their crutch.,False
youngBison: My initial impression is the husband did a poor job of explaining why he didn't want to do this. the way he said it makes him look like an asshole.,False
"niceMonkey: In addition, he provided a bunch of resources so that the parents could become independent.",False
likelyOrangutan: His attitude/tone in the post was totally disrespectful toward her parents,False
likelyGiraffe: I don't think he's TA. He can't be there all the time for them.,False
"littlePanda: I do not think he is an asshole. It can get frustrating when someone asks you for help with the same thing over and over, when the person could take it on themselves to at least try.",False
"youngBison: If he had been more polite in his explanation, I would agree with him. However, he had a meltdown and looks like an ass.",False
culturedRhino: You would have a meltdown too if you were pushed to your breaking point,False
littlePanda: I think he was frustrated when he wrote the post. He explained at the bottom that he talked to her in a respectful manner.,False
"niceMonkey: his TLDR clarified that his tone was respectful to the parents.  It was his write up that wasn't respectful, and I agree with you guys on that aspect.",False
"niceMonkey:   However, if what we read was true, he wasn't an asshole at all explaining to the parents.",False
youngBison: He should have made his case with more class. He married into the family and knew what he was getting into. He should at least be respectful to his in-laws ,False
youngBison: in bringing this up.,False
"niceMonkey: Again, it seems like he was respectful to the in laws.",False
likelyOrangutan: The parents may not have as strong an appitude to learn another language as he himself does - thats a limitation of the parents and maybe he needs to understand their limitations or what they feel comfortable doing.,False
culturedRhino: He doesn't feel comfortable continuing to be their translator either and they need to understand that as well,False
"niceMonkey: The main point is that he shouldn't be expected to be a translator, and he has provided tools so that the parents could learn.  If you decide to move to, say, Germany, it's your prerogative to learn German.",False
"youngBison: "" I told her I'm sick of dealing with her shit because she can't speak english"" - that's not being polite. ",False
culturedRhino: and he said at the bottom he didn't use that verbatim ,False
likelyOrangutan: The post also pointed out there is no official language,False

"niceMonkey: youngBison if you read the entire prompt, or listened to what we were saying, you would have known that he didn't say that.",False
littlePanda: I think he was more saying what he wanted to say to her in his head. He didn't actually tell her that. I think he let his frustration out in the post.,False

niceMonkey: thanks culturedRhino,False
littlePanda: I agree with niceMonkey,False
littlePanda: I feel we are all on the same track except for youngBison,False
"eagerBear: I thought the original poster was the ""asshole"" here because she found it ""disrespectful"" for someone to use their native tongue, i.e., the tongue they feel most comfortable with, when in conversation that clearly wasn't directed at her.",False
brightHorse: I think that if the husband feels more comfortable speaking in French then they should feel free to speak in that language. I do not see how it is disrespectful. ,False
"openCamel: I had the same initial impression. It sounded like the guy just isn't that comfortable speaking English, so I doubt they're doing it to exclude anyone.",False
livelyDolphin: This person is completely an asshole. What she said was nationalist and racist. It was also very nosey. She don't need to know everything that everyone is saying. You don't own other peoples conversations and thoughts,False
eagerBear: Exactly. She simply wanted to be eavesdropping 24/7.,False
"delightedOtter: If he was only able to say a few words in english, I understand why french is the only language he can truly communicate with.",False
"lightMonkey: I agree, OP is the asshole. Even when someone speaks a second language, it can be mentally exhausting to switch all the time--and yes, it's quite jingoistic to insist that her son and his husband speak only English around her.",False
delightedOtter: She should not be offended. But should try to understand and learn some from him,False
livelyDolphin: Right. There's no way that he'd even have a regular conversation with her because they don't speak the same language. She can't even be included though her nosey ass wants it,False
brightHorse: I understand that she might want to participate in a conversation with her son and his partner but I think the way she went about it was probably not the best.,False
"eagerBear: She came across as a busybody and nosey. I don't know if there are racist undertones in that particular example, but it is certainly rude of her to assume she's automatically privy to everyone else's conversation.",False
"lightMonkey: Furthermore, it struck me as a red flag that she first called her son's husband his ""partner"" and only later clarified that they're married.",False
livelyDolphin: I just assume if you're a nationalist you're a racist,False
fulfilledGorilla: This person is an asshole and nosey. Its her sons relationship and she needs to respect it.,False
"openCamel: Yeah true, she seemed uncomfortable about the relationship as well.",False
"livelyDolphin: Yes helperbot, both sides were considered. Ones living his life and the other is nosey",False
delightedOtter: I think this person is the asshole. She should be more considerate of the other person. This other language is the language he is best able to communicate in. The person should be more understanding and attempt to converse with the other.,False
"lightMonkey: Yes, I can see how she wants to be in on the conversation, but...too bad? Maybe she should learn French and also learn to respect others more.",False
"eagerBear: If we had to consider both sides, I can see how it can feel a little isolating to be next to two people involved in a conversation you have no access to. That happens to me and my husband's family.",False
"eagerBear: Only in the sense that she isn't able to even ""jump in"" and contribute if she had something relevant to add.",False
eagerBear: But maybe she should also learn some French. Just saying.,False
livelyDolphin: It's only an american thing to speak only one language anyhow. Shes on the wrong side of history,False

livelyDolphin: I agree on the poll,False
inspiredMonkey: I do not think they're an asshole. They were trying to accommodate their husband.,False
"novelOtter: I was torn on this one. I voted that the son wasn't the asshole, but I think he could have thought of better ways to include his mother.",False
"delightedHippo: I don't think this person's the asshole. It sounds like their husband can barely communicate in English, and it said they spoke ""mostly German"", which implies they had spoken in English a fair amount as well.",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I think the son is the asshole, as he should have included the mother since it was at her house they were staying at. Just an attempt to link both conversations, through body language. Even drawing pictures may help. ",False
"fulfilledBear: I do not the OP is the asshole but I don't quite think the mom is being the asshole, either, unless she actually called her own kid an asshole. I think it's just a tough/awkward situation and the OP is trying to make it work.",False
"novelOtter: The ""mostly"" is a good catch. I think the son could have also repeated important parts of the conversation in English after using German. That would have been beneficial for his mom and for the the husband as well.",False
inspiredMonkey: I think the poster was trying to think of both parties but found it difficult to find ways to incorporate his mom.,False
brightDolphin: I did not find the op to be an asshole. He husband is just very nervous to be in a new place with his inlaws. I can understand being nervous around your inlaws. ,False
"livelyHorse: I don't think the person is an asshole, the husband is not comfortable with English, not because he doesn't want to but because he struggles.",False
"brightDolphin: The mother got angry about it which makes her the asshole. It's okay to say that you miss your son and would like to have some more conversations, it's another thing to get angry that your son is supporting his husband. ",False
"brightDolphin: the mother is already in a comfortable place, her house, the husband is not so his feelings come first",False
inquisitiveGorilla: That is a good point,False
"novelOtter: Agreed. The son's not an asshole, but he could do more to be inclusive of both parties.",False
"delightedHippo: I agree with you fulfilledBear I don't think either of them is really an asshole unless the mom came out swinging and called them an asshole lol. If the mom had politely asked to be included, then I don't even see this as a big deal. ",False
fulfilledBear: Agreed with brightDolphin; the OP's mother is not being very compassionate. She surely has chances to talk with her child one on one and catch up that way.,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: After seeing both sides, I now think that the son is not the asshole. He needs to accomodate the guest by making him feel welcome by participating in his native language",False
brightDolphin: The mom said he was a disrepectful asshole,False
fulfilledBear: brigh,False
"fulfilledBear: Whoops, sorry :)",False
inspiredMonkey: It's a tough situation for both parties.,False
novelOtter: We aren't sure whether those are the mom's words or OP putting words in the mom's mouth.,False
fulfilledBear: brightDolphin I know the OP put it that way but I wasn't quite sure whether to take it 100% literally.,False
"fulfilledBear: Exactly, novelOtter",False
brightDolphin: I take everything literally lol,False
"delightedHippo: If that's the case, the mom is the only one being unreasonable. I think the OP is doing their best but isn't handling it like an expert, but that doesn't make them the asshole.",False
livelyHorse: The mother needs to understand the husband is insecure with his english language.,False
novelOtter: I've got some compassion for the mother. I may be in the minority here.,False
"delightedHippo: I see the mother's side for sure, I just don't think the OP is an ""asshole"" just because they aren't a master mediator. ",False
novelOtter: The son has clearly stated that the husband knows English and it seems has a high enough level of fluency but is uncomfortable with it. English is the unifying language amongst all 3. But I still do not think the son's an asshole.,False
inspiredMonkey: I voted no. I don't think the original poster is an asshole because they were trying to accommodate both sides and you can't please everyone.,False
curiousMonkey: I feel like no one is the asshole in this situation. ,False
curiousMonkey: The husband should make more of an effort to speak english to his mother while he lives int he house. ,False
"livelyGorilla: If the mother is hosting the men, she should be included in the conversation.",False
"eagerZebra: disagree, this guy is a total asshole",False
"inspiredHippo: If he only sees his mother, and lives 6 months in another country, he should use the time to focus on his mom and their relationship",False

eagerZebra: there',False
"curiousMonkey: She is gracious enough to host the couple, so they should take her into consideration. ",False

inspiredHippo: And he can speak english and his husband will still at least know whats being said,False
lightCamel: The son is the asshole. His mother doesn't speak German. The son's husband speaks English. All 3 of them have a common language they COULD speak.,False
lightCamel: She is being excluded,False
"novelHorse: well  they could always tell the mother what they just said, thats what my family does",False
"excitedBear: I get that the husband is shy about not knowing some words, but this can help him too. ",False
"openGiraffe: if theyre alone in a room together german is fine, but if they're all together just talk in english so she can feel included",False
"eagerZebra: no discussion here, when in Rome...so speak English while in mom's house",False
brightElephant: I think that the German guy should make an effort to include the mother in conversations if she is in the room,False
novelHorse: I agree with that,False
lightCamel: Agreed. German between the two of them is fine. English with all 3 is appropriate.,False
"openGiraffe: also, if the husband is uncomortable maybe it's better if he explains why to his mom so she understands too",False
"excitedBear: And, by the husband not speaking English, does he not want to get to know his mother-in-law??! That is just flat out rude.",False

"eagerZebra: yes, I agree, German when alone, English in front of mother",False
lightCamel: We do have to vote though and we can only choose that is he IS  or IS NOT the asshole.,False
inspiredHippo: Yup! same thoughts here,False
"excitedBear: Seems we are all on the same page! English when there are three, German when it is just the two of him. ",False
lightCamel: so asshole or not for not speaking English?,False
brightElephant: The mother probably feels paranoid about what they're talking about.  And possibly insulted that her son's husband doesn't want to include her,False
openGiraffe: but he probably doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of his mother-in-law if he is not able to communicate well,False
novelHorse: yeah this is a lack talking between the two if everyone explained the problem there would be no problem,False
"curiousMonkey: Agree, English with the entire group.  What they do in private is not the mother's business. ",False
"livelyGorilla: Yes, English between the three.",False
novelHorse: So we all agree then ,False
eagerZebra: yup,False
excitedBear: so he would rather exclude the mom-in-law rather than feel a bit embarrassed if he uses the wrong word? he needs to man up.,False
"brightElephant: Besides, how would the German ever get to know his mother in law if he won't talk to her.",False
lightCamel: He is the asshole. We all agree.,False
"inspiredHippo: if hes worried about being embarassed then that needs to be told to the mother, like just a heads up, he is still learning dont poke fun at his english",False
openGiraffe: I gues that makes sense,False
openGiraffe: I agree he's the asshole,False
eagerZebra: let's vote people,False
novelHorse: i agree  hes the asshole ,False
"brightElephant: Yes, the son is the asshole for not making an effort to accomodate his mother.",False
openGiraffe: yes asshole,False
"livelyGorilla: Yes, he is an asshole.",False
eagerZebra: asshole it is,False
"excitedBear: It is hard to consider the other side, because there is just no logical reason to exclude his mom from conversations.",False
"excitedBear: yes, agree that he is the butt.",False
brightElephant: And i agree that the German should take this small group opportunity to learn English better.,False
"inspiredHippo: Right, it would be much easier to explain to the mother the husbands fears then explain why your ignoring her",False
excitedBear: I agree.,False
"lightCamel: He speaks English, his vocabulary just isn't as good as his primary language.",False
lightCamel: Even people who are fluent rarely have equal vocabularies across all the languages they know.,False
lightCamel: That is a terrible reason to not want to speak English.,False
openGiraffe: The mom should be considerate about this,False
"eagerZebra: He has nothing to be shy about, it's how you learn English",False
lightCamel: Yup.,False
lightCamel: One person hasn't voted.,False
excitedBear: I voted.,False

excitedBison: i agree with that,False
fulfilledMonkey: She isn't the asshole.,False

curiousHorse: Does anyone even have any reason why she would be the asshole? this seems pretty straight forward,False
lightHippo: Well.. that was a quick consensus lol,False
delightedGiraffe: I don't understand why is her son not translating,False
excitedBison: if the husband can speak fluent English he should do it around the mother  ,False
"novelZebra: The mom cannot speak the language, so the other two should speak English in front of her.",False
openBear: i guess we can say that she made him feel upset or probably embarrassed him?,False
inquisitiveDolphin: Would it kill the dude to speak English while in the home of a non-French speaker?  Especially if its a mother in law,False
openBear: but even then i still think it's fair to say that they should speak in english,False
lightHippo: The only way she could have possibly been an asshole is if she was screaming and yelling about it instead of just asking nicely (like she presented it.),False
inquisitiveDolphin: And the son doesn't need to translate.  His partner speaks English.,False
excitedBison: The son need to translate at the very least ,False
excitedBison: true,False
"novelZebra: He did speak a few sentences in English, and she was able to understand him. Why would either of the men want to exclude the mom from conversation? It is disrespectful.",False
inquisitiveDolphin: Why bother staying at her home if they're not going to talk to her?,False
fulfilledMonkey: exactly,False
lightHippo: For a free place to stay,False
lightHippo: clearly.,False

"delightedGiraffe: if partner is shy, son can just say it and translate",False
excitedBison: it might not of been the husbands idea to visit also,False
excitedBison: still rude tho,False
novelZebra: And for the husband to go upstairs rather than speak English shows what a butt he is. Just flat out rude. ,False
lightHippo: Are we all in a agreement then that she wasn't an asshole for asking to included in conversation?,False
fulfilledMonkey: yes,False
excitedBison: yes ,False
novelZebra: I am in agreement with that.,False
brightOtter: Yes,False
openBear: yup,False
"inquisitiveDolphin: If the partner didn't speak English, then the son should translate.  But, since the partner does speak English, and they're at her home, speak English.",False
delightedGiraffe: she's not an asshole for sure,False
novelZebra: She sure did raise one though.  :-),False
"inquisitiveDolphin: Yep, this woman is not an asshole. ",False
lightHippo: The husband apparently speaks a second language with an ACCENT *gasp*,False
"curiousHorse: haha, for sure",False
lightHippo: the horror,False
fulfilledMonkey: The woman isn't making unreasonable demands.,False
"inquisitiveDolphin: Yeah, her son is a bit of an asshole.  The partner is a bigger one.",False
lightHippo: Agreed. Storming off like that was unnecessary for sure.,False

"inquisitiveDolphin: And it's not like he speaks Engish badly, he just has an accent.  And then he storms off?  What a gaping asshole.",False
lightHippo: The both sides is that she should be more considerate of his not liking his accent.,False
lightHippo: but when weighed against her being excluded... it's clear who was in the right.,False
excitedBison: agreed,False
novelZebra: The son should be considerate of that too and just not talk to the husband either.,False
lightHippo: haha,False
"delightedGiraffe: his accent is his own problem, no one said his accent sucks",False
inquisitiveDolphin: Unfortunately she only spoke English to him.  If she had said something in German instead of storming off he would have just surrendered.,False
"lightHippo: Exactly. I was just saying what the ""other side"" would be",False
fulfilledMonkey: He needs to stop being so insecure.,False
lightHippo: even if i think it's silly,False
delightedGiraffe: true,False
excitedBison: so no it is ,False
"inquisitiveDolphin: Correct, he does need to stop being insecure.  He needs to be accomodating.",False
"delightedGiraffe: let's vote, I'm saying not an asshole",False
lightHippo: Not the asshole.,False
novelZebra: Agreed.,False
"inspiredDolphin: I believe he is the asshole, why is he even there if he doesn't want to communicate with his mother.  He needs to be the conduit between the two, not shut one out in favor of the other.",False
"inspiredDolphin: I understand wanting to make his husband feel comfortable, but he could just as easily go to a hotel then if he only wants to make his husband feel good.",False
"lightBison: I think OP is the asshole. They already stated that they DO in fact know how to speak English but are just SHY.  After all, they're in her house. How disrespectful.",False

"brightElephant: I don't believe they are the asshole. It is very difficult to be in a different country as it is, so making their husband more comfortable seems like a reasonable choice.",False
openCamel: I think they are an asshole as well,False
"eagerBear: As lightBison noted, they are able to speak English but just shy. ",False
"eagerBear: There is a middle ground, where they can speak German and translate so his mother is included in the conversation",False
inspiredDolphin: I see your point brightElephant but they are enjoying the hospitality of OPs mother at no charge I assume and she does not get to see OP very often.,False
eagerBear: But to interact solely in one language leaves her out completely. This is unjustified when they're staying in her house. ,False
"openCamel: Yes, I agree. Encouraging the husband to speak English, but making it more ""okay"" to mess up or ask for a word would be helpful",False
"eagerBear: Take the reverse scenario, if he only spoke English to his mother and left his husband in the dark. Would he be the asshole in that scenario? ",False
"eagerBear: I think the answer is yes. If that's situation than how can he not be the asshole in this reverse scenario, especially when they're staying with mom. ",False
inspiredDolphin: I think OP has the responsibility to be the translator between the two.  This will also help his husband become more comfortable around family.,False
lightBison: i 100 percent agree eagerBear it's her house. I mean they can go somewhere else but not in her house especially if they are going to make the entire house awkward by only speaking to themselves. WEIRD.,False
brightElephant: I do think translating for the mother is a good option. ,False
"openCamel: Yes, helping to bridge the communication gap is helpful",False
"inspiredDolphin: More I hear your guys opinions, the more asshole I think OP is :)",False
brightElephant: I guess I can see the point that the OP might be the asshole for not including the mother as it is her house.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: OP is not the asshole, opening up your home to new family members is stressful on both sides, but the key is communication.",False
fulfilledHippo: I don't believe this person his the asshole. I think it was understandable to ask people to speak English in their home when they don't understand French.,False
excitedDolphin: I also don't believe this person is an asshole,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Even if the son felt his husband was too self conscious about it, he should have acted as translator and included both people in the conversation",False
novelGiraffe: This situation sounds pretty similar to the previous one. And i still stand with The couple being the asshole. It' not right to exclude the mother from the conversation. Especially in their own home and then only speak French to each other.,False
"fulfilledHippo: Also, if the husband can speak English, they should put forth and effort to do so in someone else's home.",False
inquisitiveOtter: Agreed,False
lightElephant: OP is not the asshole. It was a pretty straight forward request and understandable grievance. ,False
excitedDolphin: There are things the other two could be doing to be inclusive and bringing the mother in,False
lightElephant: OP did not behave in a way to alienate the couple and should be free to express her feelings in a reasonable manner. Which she did. ,False
"fulfilledHippo: I agree. If everyone can speak English, and it is OPs home, then it is a reasonable thing toask.",False
lightElephant: Agreed with what everyone has said so far. ,False
novelGiraffe: lightElephant - i agree it's not like she's asking a lot. They already both know how to speak english. It's almost as if they're doing it out of spite.,False
inquisitiveOtter: It certainly can be done without making the shy husband feel uncomfortable and would go a long way to making the family closer,False
inquisitiveOtter: Not to mention letting mom know she is appreciated.,False
"lightElephant: Exactly, there are productive ways to address this issue that is understandably difficult for both sides. But storming off based on her comment is unproductive and over dramatic",False
"fulfilledHippo: Yes. If he feels shy about it, he can work on his English in a safe environment with no judgement.",False
inquisitiveOtter: OP is not the asshole,False
"excitedDolphin: Yes, there are ways around it. Like making someone feel comfortable with messing up words if it happens, for example",False
excitedDolphin: that way he'll start more and then the mother is included,False
"excitedDolphin: but agree, letting her know she's appreciated is nice",False
"fulfilledHippo: I agree. The couple should be more open to including the mother, especially in her own home.",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: Yes, she's an asshole. She should make them feel welcome. The woman speaking french probably already feels awkward.",False
curiousHorse: This story reminds me when I first traveled abroad,False
lightBison: Was the son's partner not confident speaking English? What were they discussing? How long was the discussion going on for?  ,False
"excitedCamel: From the parents side, it is her home, they are visitors and expluding her from most conversations. On the side of the son and his partner, She hasn't said how comfortable he is in english",False
"fulfilledElephant: My initial reaction is yes, this person is the asshole. No need to make your guests feel unwanted at your house.",False
brightHippo: She could have taken her son aside and spoke to him about it and asked him to be more considerate. ,False
"curiousHorse: Yes, I totally agree. She should have start a conversation with them",False
inspiredOtter: I disagree and do not believe this person is the asshole. The son and especially his partner are guests in her house and as they are able to speak English I think they should be more considerate.,False
"eagerBear: I'm a little iffy on this because the language/cultural aspect makes it more of a sensitive topic. However, I'm still leaning heavily towards her NOT being an asshole. If he can speak English and is in front of her, he should ",False
inquisitiveGorilla: She should try to learn French.,False
novelZebra: i think its possible that she thinks they are talking in french about her in a mean way.  ,False
brightHippo: He should but if she has an issue she should have discussed it privately.,False
"lightBison: But yes, the son and his husband should be more considerate of their host and not leave her out of their conversation completely.",False
"excitedCamel: If it was occasional I can see speaking another language. But when someone does it all the time, it would feel like they don't want to talk to you.",False

"eagerBear: If he would like to have a private conversation, he should do it in private and make an effort to include her in the conversation in the only way he can, speak English.",False

curiousHorse: being nice to someone is easier but people just don't do it. ,False
lightBison: that is a good idea curiousHorse,False
curiousHorse: I think she was just gelous of her son and wanted to make him feel bad. ,False
fulfilledElephant: That was my initial thought too curiousHorse - the poster was jealous.,False
"excitedCamel: As for her needing to talk to her son privatly. This is her son's partner, a part of the family. She should be able to talk to them openly as well. It's not like she embarrassed them in front of a group.",False
"inspiredOtter: eagerBear I agree, since the partner can speak English and is a guest they should.",False
novelZebra: i would say she is being the asshole here but really i than k they both are.,False
curiousHorse: inquisitiveGorilla I do not think the son could have said anything,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I'm not sure she was jealous but people do tend to feel uncomfortable when someone speaks a different language. However, she could have asked if she could learn french or anything to help her husbands girl feel welcome.",False
eagerBear: Jealous of her son? They are having a private conversation in front of her. They could easily speak English and be respectful of her.,False
curiousHorse: The fact that he left shows he did not have a good relation with his mother. ,False
lightBison: Personally - I feel left out when people are speaking in a manner that I cannot understand when I am part of the group.  Even if it is a topic I don't understand not just the language.  ,False
brightHippo: Yes. eagerBear is right. It's about respect and they were being disrepectful.,False
"excitedCamel: If they wanted a private conversation, they could have easily come up with an excuse to leave the room for a moment.",False
eagerBear: I agree with lightBison,False
"curiousHorse: eagerBear Rember, the guy was not speaking English",False
curiousHorse: lightBison You are also right! ,False
"eagerBear: I know but he is still failing to respect his mother. If you've ever had someone speak another language in front of you, it's not a good feeling. You feel like they can be talking about you behind your back",False
inspiredOtter: I do not see a reason for them to speak a language the mother cannot understand with her in the room when they are both capable of doing so.,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I believe the woman was an asshole because she could have gone about this in a different way. ,False
lightBison: I believe that the son and his partner were the assholes - not the mother,False
curiousHorse: I think the best wat would have been for her son to translate to bith of them,False
brightHippo: I think it was the mother. ,False
curiousHorse: I believe now the son was the asshole,False
excitedCamel: I don't think anyone was an asshole in this situation. It's sensible be polite and include the entire group in a converrsation and easily avoidable,False
curiousHorse: he should have translated for both of them,False
openOtter: I believe she is not an asshole for wanting make her husband feel comfortable but there were things she could have done to help the situation.,False
"brightGorilla: The mom asked that her daughter include her in conversations, and the daughter refused. Refusing after the mom asked nicely is rude.",False
inspiredElephant: The daughter should be respectful and include her mom. At the very least translate.,False
"curiousGiraffe: I understand that the husband is shy about speaking english. But this is her home, and it sounds like she doesn't get to see them often. Not including her is rude.",False
"livelyBear: This one is difficult since he knows he's in a difficult spot so I don't think he's a complete asshole but since he is in his mother's house, both him and his husband could've worked to include his mother more.",False
"openOtter: She could have told her mom that she could help her learn the language, or tell her what is going on in the conversations, tell her she could get her a translator on her phone and it would be fun, etc.",False
excitedMonkey: I think she was not an asshole,False
novelBison: They should speak the language of the host they are visiting.  ,False
"fulfilledCamel: This is a tough one for me, and personally I believe neither of them to be assholes. The poster is not an asshole for wanting to make their husband feel comfortable, the mother is not an asshole for wanting to be included in her own home.",False
inspiredElephant: I understand the mom's point of view. She wants to get caught up and how can she do that if he keeps speaking in a foreign language?,False
novelBison: i agree fulfilledCamel,False
excitedMonkey: I think she was trying to make her husnand comfortable,False
"openOtter: However, she was caught between a rock and a hard place because she wanted to please her husband and didn't want to make her mom mad.",False
brightGorilla: The daughter could at least translate things for her mom to let the mom “in” on the conversation.,False
novelBison: The poster is a man btw,False
"livelyBear: For the people suggesting she learn the language, you're underestimating how difficult that is. ",False
excitedMonkey: openOtter you are right! She was in the middle!,False
inspiredElephant: I do agree this one is tricky. I can see both sides.,False
"curiousGiraffe: I think he's been put in a spot where he has be be an asshole to one or the other. Or atleast seen as one. But it does come down to the fact he chose to exclude someone, over making someone a bit more comfortable.",False
"brightGorilla: thank you, novel",False
excitedMonkey: inspiredElephant Parents get gealous when their children have their own families,False
"openOtter: I agree, brightGorilla include the mom by translating or helping her get a translator on her phone. I bet the mom  would've had fun. ",False
inspiredElephant: Yeah translating I think would have been his best option to keep everyone happy.,False
"livelyBear: Unfortunately, since we have to say yes, or no, I would have to say, yes he's an asshole since he didn't at least try to include her but like I said, it's tough",False
excitedMonkey: openOtter I agree. The mom has to be included as well in the conversation. ,False
"novelBison: The poster says that his husband feels ""shy"" about it - well as they say - practice makes perfect.  How is he going to learn if he doesn't practice?",False
openOtter: curiousGiraffe you are right. SHe had to be an asshole either way.,False
"excitedMonkey: openOtter I agree with you, she is an asshole",False
"novelBison: I would definitely like a ""neither one"" option or ""both"" ",False
inspiredElephant: I agree novelBison He should take it as an opportunity to practice.,False
openOtter: I still think she wasn't an asshole even though she could have gone about it a different way. ,False
curiousGiraffe: They could have all gotten a bit of practice and fun in.,False
"fulfilledCamel: Agreed, neither of them particularly are assholes, but the son should have made son attempt to include his own mother in conversation in her home.",False
"livelyBear: Guys, it's not a she. The only female is the mother. The person writing this a guy and he is married to a man.",False
"openOtter: So what do you guys think overall, asshole, or no?",False
novelBison: it's a coin toss - but in the end i think that the poster is slightly more of the asshole,False
"livelyBear: Yes, asshole",False
"curiousGiraffe: Yeah, a reluctant asshole",False
"fulfilledCamel: Asshole, made no attempt to include mother.",False
"brightGorilla: I see both sides, but yes, asshole",False
inspiredElephant: yes assshole,False
"openOtter: Lol, I like that, reluctant asshole. You guys have convinced me because of the argument that she was an asshole either way. ",False
"excitedMonkey: I agree with you all, she was not noce",False
"livelyBear: Yeah, we unfortunately need to say that the poster (male) is an asshole even though he was in a difficult spot. ",False
"excitedMonkey: Yes, livelyBear ",False
curiousGiraffe: Family seems to put everyone in a position where they have to be an asshole at some point in there life.,False
excitedMonkey: you are right,False
"openOtter: Great job guys, we have all agreed that she was an asshole because she just had to be unfortunately.",False
excitedMonkey: yes,False
excitedMonkey: she was,False
eagerGiraffe: I think they're not really an asshole but they need to compromise,False
"excitedGorilla: My initial impression is that this person is the asshole. It seems as though what started off as help for her parents has become an assumption and a duty, whilst her parents have made no progress in learning English.",False
lightBison: I think she is for pushing her parents off all the time on her husband.  I'm sure he has things to do too.,False
novelOtter: I think they are not the asshole but yes they need to appriecate the spouse effort,False
curiousDolphin: I feel if it's only occasional then it's perfectly fine,False
eagerGiraffe: They could share the work of translating more evenly,False
"novelOtter: i mean in the end, if the spouse has an issue with it, they are the asshole for continuing to expect it",False
openMonkey: I think that neither one is an asshole(that's a rather strong term).  He is complaining about a minor inconvenience though.,False
livelyCamel: It is not a big deal when he spends his time helping his wife's family.  Her family is his family too.  ,False
"excitedGorilla: It also never really states how often they call, which can depend from each side how 'rarely' this is happening.",False
lightBison: She could also help her parents get set up to learn English.,False
novelOtter: Yeah but for them to learn english is a huge ordeal,False
eagerGiraffe: I think they can resolve it pretty easily by talking so no one has to be the asshole,False
"curiousDolphin: Since its based on how busy they are, maybe it could shift back and forth to share responsibility.",False
"excitedGorilla: Even though they are family, you have no obligation to help them every single time. ",False
openMonkey: The whole thing is a minor issue compared to people with real problems.,False
novelOtter: true,False
novelOtter: so whats the vote?,False
openMonkey: I agree that they probably just need to talk about it more.,False
lightBison: It is a huge ordeal to learn another language but I'd be more happy to help someone if I knew they were trying to help themself,False
curiousDolphin: I also feel that you know what you are getting into early on. So he was aware.,False
eagerGiraffe: I think whoever said asshole is too strong a term is right and they're not the asshole,False
livelyCamel: He is an asshole.,False
"novelOtter: And learning english would only help their entire lives, it would be a huge help to them overall and maybe they need the push to do it?",False
excitedGorilla: Her family also live in America and it must be a massive hassle to not speak English here.,False
curiousDolphin: My answer is that she is not and he is being selfish at the moment.,False
"novelOtter: agree, she is not the asshole",False
lightBison: I agree it's a strong word to use but in this case I'd say she's the asshole for expecting her husband to always handle her parents. She could easily show them how to use an online learning tool or translation tool.,False
livelyCamel: She is  not an asshole.,False
"openMonkey: If I had to make a choice then I would choose him, but I would just call him a whiner.  As far As I can tell she is not the asshole.",False
"novelOtter: so we have one member that thinks she is the asshole, the rest do not?",False
"eagerGiraffe: she's also working and in school, so it's unreasonable for the parents to expect her help constantly",False
curiousDolphin: She is not the asshole in this situation. She has been busy and he should understand that and help occasionally.,False
novelOtter: can we come to an aggreement?,False
excitedGorilla: Her parents really have no excuse after this long to still rely on her husband to translate.,False
openMonkey: She should still help if she has the time and he's busy.,False
brightMonkey: I think the OP isn't telling the whole story when he says he was completely respectful,False
fulfilledOtter: It is frustrating when your daily activity is interrupted.,False
eagerGorilla: I don't think he's being an asshole at all.,False
novelZebra: I think that he is kind of the asshole because he was rude about it and very much expected the mother to learn english.  i can see encouraging her but demanding is just making him the asshole,False
"excitedHippo: He very well may be the asshole, but I am taking his word for it that he was very polite.",False
livelyElephant: The verdict is based on if he is the asshole for telling her to learn English instead of just helping her.,False
eagerGorilla: It's frustrating when someone won't try to help themself.  If they were trying then it's easier to help them.,False
openBear: I feel that he is venting online but probably wasn't a total jerk when speaking to the family member.,False
"brightMonkey: the whole family got upset at him, so I think there may be a pattern of being less than respectful",False
"livelyElephant: I feel like he isn't the asshole for wanting them to learn some English after 8 years, but it does sound like he did it in a nasty way.",False
"livelyElephant: Even if you take into account his version where he said it nicely, his post clearly gives off the vibe that he is a bit of an asshole in general.",False
openBear: I believe the family member has been coddled since they can't even do basic things such as order food and he's rightfully frustrated.,False
"novelZebra: just because he could learn another language doesn't mean another person can, that's an expectation that is totally unfair I feel",False
"excitedHippo: I think that telling someone to learn English and helping them to find resources to do so is considerate and helpful, but It depends on how respectful he was.",False
"livelyElephant: I mean, it's not hard to learn a language in 8 years when you live in the country it is spoken.",False
eagerGorilla: I think he should of said it to her differently but I don't think he's an asshole.  ,False
brightMonkey: I think he's right to be frustrated but based on their reactions I don't think he expressed it perfectly respectfully,False
novelZebra: I feel like it might be harder than you think,False
novelZebra: depending on your age,False
excitedHippo: His tone leads me to believe that he might have been a little more rude than he let on.,False
novelZebra: I agree,False
"openBear: I feel he may have finally snapped because he's done it for so long. That's human, not being an asshole. ",False
"fulfilledOtter: I, however, believe he needs to arrange his time to help our his wife's family because we all have our own difficulty.",False
"brightMonkey: if he only did exactly what he said I don't think they would have said he was a ""racist trump supporter etc""",False
livelyElephant: After 8 years in the country without being able to even order food from a restaurant you are taking the piss.,False
eagerGorilla: I think he could of handled it differently but I can understand his frustration.,False
eagerGorilla: He almost sounds a little cocky that he learned several languages fast and expects others to that fast.  ,False
novelZebra: yeah I think you might be right livelyElephant I didn't think of it like that,False
openBear: When you suddenly stop doing what people expect they can be rather hateful and accuse you of things that aren't true. ,False
excitedHippo: I agree that nothing he said would indicate that he was racist or a Trump supporter.  Either they(the extended family) are the ones being assholes or he left some things out.,False
novelZebra: I think you might have made me change my opinoin,False
"novelZebra: I thought he was the asshole, but I am thinking maybe not now",False
eagerGorilla: I'm not sure how or why they would even bring Trump into this conversation.  Sounds like there's more going on between all of them then just this,False
"brightMonkey: it sounds like there's more to the story, and that OP isn't a reliable narrator",False
excitedHippo: I agree with openBear  Sometimes people just take you for granted.,False
livelyElephant: Glad I am not in that family.,False
openBear: People are either with you or against you. The trump comment could convey that with how they intended it. ,False
"novelZebra: In conclusion, depending on his tone of delivery, he is not the asshole for expecting this mother to learn the language and help herself.  ",False
openBear: I believe that he is not the asshole because I think they are just angry that he no longer is doing what has come to be expected of him. ,False
eagerGorilla: I just think there is more resentment there then just this one situation,False
"excitedHippo: I agree with novelZebra that it all depends on his tone, but I'll take his word for it.'",False
novelBison: What do you all think?,False
livelyOtter: She should have approached it more nicely. The guy couldnt speak good english and theyre young,False
curiousHorse: i  think it  was  rude  of  the kids  to speak  french the whole time when they know english,False
"eagerElephant: Honestly, I understand why she is frustrated. I do not know if ""disrespectful"" is the right word to use, but everyone wants to feel included, especially in their own home.",False
"brightGorilla: I think while it doesn't really matter what language the son and husband speak, the mother can assume some respect for the fact that she only speaks english.",False
"novelBison: I feel like that's true, but also they should include her in the conversation",False
"livelyOtter: She should have made them aware in an easier way, but yes, they were indulgent and unwittingly disrespectful",False
"brightGorilla: I think she could have been nicer about it, perhaps made a joke of it.",False
novelBison: So she isn't the asshole?,False
brightGorilla: The mother is not the asshole in my opinion.,False
"eagerElephant: I don't think she is the asshole. Misguided a bit, but not an asshole.",False
"livelyOtter: If she was nicer then they would have probnably learned and adjusted, so as the adult she is the asshole, i think",False
curiousHorse: when  I  dated a  french canadain  her and  her  entire  family spoke english around me  and  when their  friends  refused  to  speak english  even they  found it  rude ,False
novelBison: Agreed! Misguided non asshole.,False
"brightGorilla: You're right. A little misguided, and maybe she is making a big deal out of nothing, but she's not an asshole for this.",False
lightMonkey: It is kinda rude but at the same time there's not much the dude can do if he'd be butchering English and taking 10 times as long to get something across. No one's really at fault here,False
"livelyOtter: In the end she isnt, I agree. They shouldnt freak out over a bit over frustration ",False
brightGorilla: They should definitely be more sensitive to the situation instead of storming off.,False
curiousHorse: i agree,False
"livelyOtter: yes, both sides considered. A family history of their relationship might have made this easier",False
"novelBison: I can understand the sensitivity, but they should understand how she feels.",False
"eagerElephant: It might be rooted in his insecurity about speaking the other language. I've been in multiple situations where I was the only  person not fluent in Spanish, it was painful for all involved and especially mentally taxing. ",False
livelyOtter: all true,False
"eagerElephant: It still does not make his reaction appropriate, just maybe some context!",False
brightGorilla: Yes. I think it might be better to see this as an opportunity to improve the english in a low-risk environment instead of being insecure and therefore only speaking french. ,False
"brightGorilla: In other words, I think there is more risk for him speaking French and coming off as rude to the mother (clearly) than having a bit of trouble speaking English.",False
"livelyOtter: I'll say no, not an asshole. They're an emotional family and don't have the best communication skills",False
curiousHorse: i agree   no  not a  asshole  ,False
eagerElephant: I agree! Hopefully this is a learning experience for all!,False
"lightMonkey: Not the asshole, just awkward all around more than anything",False
"delightedOtter: I think that this person should respect that his mother wants to reconnect with him, and that her only language is English.",False
openGorilla: I  believe it  was a  bit  unreasonable of  her  to exclude her  mom    she  could  have translated  everything,False
delightedOtter: I think both of these people are men,False

"delightedOtter: They give the genders at the beginning, so no need to worry!",False
inquisitiveCamel: Ohh right! Thank you!! Did not see that!,False
delightedOtter: You're welcome!,False
openGorilla: bit of a  long  task  so i may have mixed  up  genders between  different  storys,False
delightedOtter: It's all good.,False
delightedOtter: I think that the fact that the husband is slightly insecure about english is not enough to make the mother feel left out.,False
"excitedDolphin: Technically not an asshole thing to do given the context, but his justifications are kinda assholish in themselves",False
delightedOtter: This is a low-risk environment and I am sure the mother would excuse any english trouble.,False
openGorilla: i agree. i think the mother  woudl  have  just been happy to be  included,False
"delightedOtter: Also, if the boys were moving in or something, maybe I could understand there being a compromise between English and German. ",False

"curiousDolphin: If mom was visiting them it would be different but being at mom's house, they should talk to mom",True
livelyElephant: Hi team. I don't think there are any assholes in this scenario. But I do believe there should be some compromise. It is ok for OP to talk the language she wants but maybe not 100% of the time.,False
excitedGorilla: I feel like this person is not the asshole. He chose this person to be with and he should make them feel comfortable. On the other hand though the partner should learn to speak english better to include the mom in the near future,False

"openZebra: German is much harder than English, too lol",False
delightedBear: It doesn't seem like poster has thought through all of his options. ,False
inspiredHippo: why,False
delightedBear: But I like the idea of the mother trying to learn German so both she and the husband are slightly uncomfortable together,False
"openZebra: Yeah, the poster definitely hasn't thought this through. I think because they're clouded by the fact that they want their hubby to feel wanted and comfy",False

brightOtter: yes i agree,False
"inspiredDolphin: I totally agree! Good intentions, terrible delivery.",False
inspiredDolphin: She should have pulled the son aside while the partner wasn't in the same room and asked him in private to consider her more when they were all together.,False
novelHippo: I think it's common courtesy to speak the language most people in the house are speaking.,False
brightOtter: i believe the mom shouldn't have to be left out,False
"delightedCamel: I think so too, especially if they are staying at the mom's house",False
"lightGiraffe: I think that the poster isn't the asshole. The post said that the partner KNOWS english just fine, just has an accent and barely spoke english the entire time",False

brightOtter: exacly. it would be different if he couldn't speak english,False
livelyZebra: I agree that they should try to speak some English at least during some parts of the day like lunch or dinner.,False
novelHippo: If they were teenagers it would make sense but adults should speak together like adults.,False
lightGiraffe: for the dude to just get up and walk out IS rude though.,False

inspiredDolphin: Language barriers are always hard,False
brightOtter: yes that was rude ,False
delightedCamel: I agree,False
novelHippo: It's hard to know how it was delivered too.  Was it a polite what are you talking about?,False
"lightGiraffe: The partner is 20.. that was pure disrespect. If that happened in his parent's home, they would have no problem calling them out for speaking English over french",False
"livelyZebra: But I don't know why she immediately assumes that they are doing it to exclude her and disrespect her. I think she could have just asked: ""Hey, what are y'all talking about?"" Maybe they were talking about some funny joke in French...",False
"brightOtter: i understand that it mightve felt like an attack too though, but he couldve understood instead of feeling like that ",False
livelyZebra: There was a way for everyone involved to be more thoughtful,False

brightOtter: i would feel disrespected if people were speaking in a different language if i had invited them over to hang out,False

inquisitiveElephant: racist  ,False
"delightedZebra: I do not think anyone should feel responsible for the well-being of another and in this case, he does given that his MIL needs him so much",False

livelyGorilla: I think it's become a bit of a burden on him and he wants to help her so she can live her life on her own,False
inquisitiveElephant: i agree that all should learn ,False

excitedOtter: People are just conditioned to call stuff racist now.,False
inquisitiveElephant: thing before he do,False
inquisitiveElephant: he may asshold,False
inquisitiveElephant: should punish,False
delightedZebra: I consider her side in that she needs help. I also consider his side in that he shouldn't feel responsible for her. I think she should take the help to be able to navigate things on her own. And he is not the asshole ,False
"fulfilledBison: Yes, but I believe in looking at evidence before making an accusation of racism.  He is not an asshole; he simply vented in the beginning of the passage",False
inspiredDolphin: He seems to have an off putting personality. but I did not think the question made him an asshole. It is probably very draining to take care of someone this way. And he tries to help take care of her by offering resources.,False

livelyBear: agree,True
livelyBear: she is asshole,True
inspiredHippo: I can see what you're saying but it's also a bit unreasonable to expect him to continuously help out. ,False
livelyBear: he is helpeing,True
fulfilledHorse: She is ridiculous and sounds like a terrible person.,False
inspiredHippo: I think him saying that they should try to learn English will help them more in the future,False
livelyBear: i agree,True
curiousZebra: I guess all we can determine now is that she is not the asshole for needing some help as well. What they need to do as a family is come together and compromise somehow,False
livelyBear: that's good sound,True
inspiredHippo: I think she's the asshole in this situatuon,False
fulfilledHorse: She openly mocks her husband and expects him to be on call for her whole family.,False
"excitedGiraffe: I kind of do think she is being an ""asshole."" For one she should not be expecting her husband to take care of her mother because she is too busy. And saying her parents should not have to try is not any better.",False
livelyBear: yes,True
"inspiredHippo: Of course she has a lot going on, but he doesn't have to be there 24/7 to help out.",False
"inspiredHippo: He also learned Spanish, so he's helping to his highest ability ",False

livelyBear: yes,True
livelyBear: i agree,True
curiousZebra: yes! take her to the guillotine !,False
excitedGiraffe: I wonder who would help if she did not have her husband...,False

livelyBear: good sound,True
excitedGiraffe: She would probably not take well to him not taking the time to do anything extra.,False
"livelyBear: I'm fairly flexible on my opinion, but I'm of the belief the perosn is being the asshole by assuming there was negative intent when there probably was not",False
livelyBear: What are your opinions?,False
eagerElephant: I agree. You can't assume they were talking about you and he may not be comfortable speaking english as a 2nd language,False
openDolphin: I believe the person is the asshole because they've invited a foreign person into their house and should expect a language barrier.,False
inquisitiveCamel: I don't think it is nice when people can speak your language but choose to speak another and leave you out it's rude.,False
inquisitiveCamel: The son was an asshole for leaving his mother out of the conversation. ,False

inquisitiveCamel: If the son came to visit why exclude his Mother in the conversation if he can speak English?,False
livelyBear: Can we agree for sake of this exercise that she is being the asshole,False
openDolphin: yes,False
eagerElephant: Yes,False
novelHorse: Yes,False
livelyBear: @inquisitivecamel Maybe because he's not sure how to proceed?,False
inquisitiveCamel: Yes,False
livelyBear: Or maybe he also has trouble with French toa small extent?,False
inquisitiveCamel: Not sure maybe?,False
"livelyBear: I don't disagree with you, but based on the context",False
"livelyBear:  and the admission that the French person already had trouble speaking English, it makes me wonder if this just wasn't set up properly ",False
novelHorse: It may come off rude. But maybe she could ask why they're speaking French instead of jumping to conclusions ,False
livelyBear: novelHorse very true,False
inquisitiveCamel: He had an accent is all but could speak English. Guess he doesn't care what his husband's Mom thinks,False
"livelyBear: We are agreed that she is the asshole, but with some reservations",False

novelHippo: How old is this guy? ,False
curiousBear: When you are a guest especially in someones home you should be at your upmost consideration to follow rules.  He should of translated to his husband and the husband who spoke little English had an opportunity to learn.  ,False

novelHippo: The husband hopefully will learn some English since he lives here half the year.,False
curiousBear: The marriage will not work because one of them have a control problem and the other one is weak.,False
novelHippo: Yes trouble with that marriage!,False
"curiousBear: You repect others homes, parents or don't be a guest.",False

fulfilledCamel: ex,False
"livelyBison: I had a difficult time deciding with this one because I could understand both sides, but how she approached it made her seem like an asshole. If the partner didn't speak much English it would be hard for him to really communicate.",False

"livelyBison: Oh okay I misread, I thought that he didn't speak English well and that's why he was speaking in French.",False
"openGiraffe: Well, it feels like Mom is being a little generous to herself--just because someone has said a few sentences, does not mean that they're fluent.",False
openGiraffe: The French guy could know some English but still not really feel comfortable having a conversation in English.,False
eagerGorilla: I dont think anyone in this case is an asshole. Both just misunderstood it seems. ,False

brightGorilla: He could have politely asked her to no longer use him as a translotr,False

"inspiredZebra: @hippo, I think we vote both about the communication style and his underlying goals.",False
brightGorilla: Yes,False
"fulfilledHippo: He seemed pretty considerate and happy to help to start out, but it took a real turn.  He didn't even talk about how it was random and messing with his days, that came up in the edit",False

fulfilledHippo: You can be helpful but still a real a**hole that not one wants,False
delightedBison: yah maybe if he had said things differently,False
brightGorilla: I vote he is an asshole as well. He was not trying to help his MIL. He was trying to help himself. And his tone was abrasive (even after the fact) and rooted in racism. ,False

brightCamel: *other inquisitiveHorse,False
"openBear: I don't think she was being an asshole, but she has different expectations of family interactions than him.",False

brightCamel: I agree eagerZebra,False
excitedMonkey: true,False
inquisitiveHorse: I cannot imagine asking her to ask someone else for help,False

inquisitiveHorse: She is a very small asshole for not clearing it with her husband first.,False
"openBear: If he feels like it is too frequent, that's a conversation he needs to have. She isn't being an asshole by having him do something he agreed to do.",False

"delightedBison: I agree that it's difficult for the parents to learn English, and that someone helping with translation is valid. But that doesn't mean it should always be the husband.",False

livelyHippo: I'm struggling to learn a second language (Japanese) and so I have sympathy for the metal exhaustion translating must cause. It can't be easy.,False
"openBear: Lastly, I think that asshole is a hard word for her, but to make it short, I think he has the right to say no to translating",False
novelMonkey: either way would be difficult and cultural differences should be kept in mind,False

inquisitiveGorilla: this is an everyone is an asshole situation,False
"lightOtter: While I don't think he's trying to be one, I think the way he comes off makes him the asshole.",False

"lightOtter: He shouldn't have to translate, but he shouldn't force he parents to learn English",False
excitedCamel: I think this person was right in encouraging his MIL to become more independent in learning English and not rely on him several times a day for translations. The MIL has been in the country long enough to speak basic English,False
"openHippo: He's an asshole for many reasons, but first on my list is this assumption that because he learned a few languages quickly, that anyone can. Not all of us are that smart.",False
inquisitiveGorilla: he could also try and teach them some english if he has the time,False
"openHippo: And as delightedZebra noted, she's older and therefore it's going to be harder to learn.",False
"lightOtter: Also, we've gotta note the edit where he clarified that he tried to be respectful instead of saying ",False

"lightOtter: I don't think he has to be a translator, but learning a new language is a daunting task, no matter how much you're surrounded by it. ",False
fulfilledMonkey: In the edit he also swore at everyone,False

excitedCamel: He was expressing his frustration in the credit,False
lightOtter: Yeah he seems like an asshole to us as well haha,False
inquisitiveGorilla: it is hard but it is impossable if you never try and translating all the time doesnt help them learn,False
livelyGiraffe: He definately came across terribly,False
"openHippo: It's funny, if his post had come off less negative and frustrated, he might've changed opinions.  Instead he comes off as an asshole just because of his tone, even if he has some points.",False
delightedZebra: I consider him to be an asshole because he is not considerate. ,False
livelyGiraffe: Nowadays you can get a translator on a smartphone for simple things,False
"lightOtter: I think the situation didn't make him an asshole, but the way he seems to have handled it makes him the asshole.",False
inquisitiveGorilla: i think everyone in the senario are aholes,False
fulfilledMonkey: I agree with openHippo,False
"fulfilledMonkey: Yes, agreed that it's his handling of the situation that makes him the asshole. He can't express his opinion in a constructive way.",False
excitedCamel: His saying he was tired of her shit made him look like the asshole at first until he added to the post. ,False
openHippo: Dang. Two minutes left and we are all in agreement.,False
"lightOtter: If he sounded like he was more doing it out of mutual benefit then I might have seen it differently, but he was doing it solely for himself",False
excitedCamel: I'm not. I don't think he was the asshole. ,False
"delightedZebra: yes, this one is a no brainer, his assumption that everyone is capable of learning fast like him is very wrong. ",False
inquisitiveGorilla: i think they are all assholes,False

lightOtter: I think we need a surprise witness,False

excitedCamel: I'm just looking at it different. ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: yeah he comes across like a jerk,False
"openHippo: I'd be upset too if someone kept pestering me for translation work, though.",False

lightMonkey: I agree with most of you here that the couple should be more considerate ,False
curiousGiraffe: I'm sure she felt bad but she scolded a kid (age 20) about being disrespectful when she could have said it a nice way. There's no nice way to say someone is disrespectful.,False
eagerBear: I side with the mother. I think the only way she could be the asshole is if she blew up at the two of them and just didn't mention it in her post.,False
lightMonkey: And she should have handled the situation more gracefully ,False
lightMonkey: I also side with the mother ,False
"curiousGiraffe: She could have said, Please speak English, or other nice things to say",False
"fulfilledOtter: refusing to speak in english when he knows she can't speak french. She absolutely could have spoken more politely, but if they wanted to have a private conversation they could have taken it to another room",False
excitedBison: I think the couple overreacted as well.,False
lightMonkey: Yeah I agree that the couple was overreacted ,False

"delightedElephant: Im not sure if I can see it from the other side, the only thing I can think is maybe they were having a sidebar convo. at the same time i think it could have waited",False
fulfilledOtter: The mother could have handled it better agreed but they are old enough to know that that's socially rude,False
"curiousGiraffe: yes, they are immature. They are young people (age 24, 20)",False
fulfilledOtter: Old enough to know better.,False
"lightMonkey: Not sure if the situation was different if she went over to France and was accused of not speaking French, but I'm just speaking for whatever I read here ",False

"curiousGiraffe: Would you really embarrass someone in your house like that, and speak to this young guy like he was in kindergarden?",False

curiousElephant: She rarely spoke English or translated to English for her husband to her mother?,False
openHorse: I think the son is being an asshole.,False

brightOtter: i think he is the asshole,False
curiousElephant: It's embarassing because I have the opposite opinion from last time. maybe everyone agrees then.,False
openHorse: I think there are ways to make them both feel comfortable.,False
livelyCamel: The sons bf should have been okay with being uncomfortable for just a little ,False
"lightHippo: They're the assholes. ^ Right? kid could have translated if the husband felt uncomfortable speaking english, but the other side is, they live there half the year and he doesn't feel comfortable speaking english?!",False

"curiousElephant: OK, I misread it.",False
"excitedBear: I think he is on the wrong side here since theyre living in her house. He said that it's his right to be able to speak whatver he wants, but it's also her house so he could kick them both out",False

curiousElephant: I don't understand why the son wouldn't translate the German for the mother.,False

curiousElephant: Thanks yes I read it wrong.,False
lightHippo: I don't understand why if he lives in the United States 50% of the time he's uncomfortable speaking english?!,False

"excitedBear: And from his perspectivie, I also think that the mother could have handled it more gracefully, like in previous scenarios ",False
"lightHippo: I think the kids are rude as heck. Mom is providing meals and somewhere to stay, the least you can do is bother including your mom in some conversations.",False
lightHippo: even SOME of them.,False
eagerGorilla: The mother should be included because she had not seen her son for quite a while.,False
"brightOtter: for them to visit her, they should just speak english",False
"curiousElephant: I got the impression this mother at least scolded the son in private, and didn't ream out his husband.",False
"excitedBear: I think it was super nice of the mom to house them at first, doing something as simple as speaking english to her when they see her is not that hard of a task ",False
curiousElephant: They were kind of using the mother for food. I don't understand why they were even visiting.,False
"brightOtter: right, they can have their sidebar covo later. especially since shes providing for them",False
curiousElephant: It seems like everyone here agrees pretty much this time?,False
"excitedBear: I think the son's tone was a bit overacting, since in fact we're not even sure if she was that rude ",False

brightOtter: a little more consideration from the son would have been nice,False
excitedBear: ye i think we all agree,False
openHorse: i would conclude that the person was being an asshole,False
curiousElephant: We conclude that it was rude to speak mostly German the whole weekend and then feel like that was their right.,False

inspiredHippo: Hello guys,False
eagerDolphin: what is everyone considering so far,False
delightedGiraffe: hello! ,False
inspiredHippo: Well so far it definitely seems like the husband is being very rude.,False
inspiredHippo: Anybody else thinking the same?,False
eagerDolphin: Yeah I think the husband has some valid points but his attitude is very poor,False
excitedCamel: I think she is the asshole because she isn't considering the husband's perspective.,False
"livelyElephant: I think she is the Asshole because she has pretty much put her parents off on her husband and giving him more responsibility than he signed up for, but I agree with his attitude about it being very poor",False
excitedCamel: The husband didn't grow up having to translate for family members.,False
"curiousHorse: Hello, I found this a scenario where I don't think there is an asshole. I think the wife is just in asking the husband to help out. I do think the wife could take some initiative to help as well. ",False
excitedCamel: He didn't know that would be a responsibility in his marriage.,False
delightedGiraffe: I disagree . I think he is being helpful and shouldn’t have to come to his mother in laws every beck and call. ,False
inspiredHippo: The husband however could describe the situation much better. They are his family after all and he is talking about them like they are random people,False
eagerDolphin: I really wish there was an option where both are the asshole or not,False
excitedCamel: I think the husband is being helpful but sounds like he is being taken advantage of.,False
delightedGiraffe: Yes! Option 3- they are both assholes LOL ,False
"livelyElephant: Right, I found this one a middle of the road offense lol",False
curiousHorse: I agree he is being taken advantage of a bit and frustrated. ,False
inspiredHippo: I could go with they're both assholes as well. She could very well translate herself and he could have a better attitude.,False
eagerDolphin: I understand that the wife is really busy but she still needs to help out since they are her parents,False
curiousHorse: The wife should show more of a willingness to help. She is pawning her parents off on her hubby. ,False
excitedCamel: I vote that she is the asshole in this story.,False
inspiredHippo: I think he thinks he is being taken advantage of but the parents probably didn't have that intention,False
delightedGiraffe: I agree as well! I don’t think the husband should have to help out ALL the time. Only when he is available. He has a life too! ,False
"livelyElephant: Exactly, they are HER parents not his, and a few times helping might have been good but just leaving them to be his responsibility is simply being an asshole",False
inspiredHippo: Has he tried to talk to them about it? Maybe they just think he wants to help,False
"eagerDolphin: Yeah I think since we have to pick one option, i'd say she was the asshole",False
excitedCamel: No one has bad intentions here. She is being an unintentional asshole.,False
curiousHorse: I would agree with her being the asshole. She could show more support for her husband and relize she is asking a lot. ,False
eagerDolphin: I'm sure the wife knows from growing up how frustrating it can be having to translate for her parents,False
delightedGiraffe: I agree with her being the asshole as well. ,False
eagerDolphin: so for her to put it all on her husband right now is not fair,False
"inspiredHippo: I have now changed my opinion to her being the asshole, she could be taking half the load off to help.",False
inquisitiveGorilla: I'm thinking she's the asshole since she's trying to p[ut it all on her husband,False
inspiredHippo: I also think she is the asshole as she expects him to do everything and is putting all of it on him and not thinking about him.,False
delightedGiraffe: I believe this person is the asshole because she is expecting too much from her husband. ,False
eagerDolphin: Yeah she is definitely not doing enough herself right now,False

livelyGiraffe: I agree. I don’t blame him. ,False
"excitedHippo: I don't think he is either, just frustrated.",False
fulfilledDolphin: I can understand his frustration but he handled the situation horribly. I think he is definitley the asshole. ,False
eagerOtter: I feel he is the asshole as well,False
livelyGiraffe: He said he didn’t say he’s sick of her shit and he was polite about it. ,False
"delightedHorse: He respectfully offered his help and resources, he said he never was being disrespectful to her",False
"inspiredGorilla: Take the language thing out and it's ""my mother in law constantly requires my assistance and needs to become more self sufficient.""",False
excitedHippo: I think he handled it poorly at first but based on his edit it seemed like he was rather polite and helpful,False
eagerOtter: I think he made a mistake in telling her to be independent ,False
"livelyGiraffe: It’s not like he was being paid for all of it. Why should he put his life on hold for people who are too lazy to try to learn something themselves? There are resources out there, apps, etc. ",False
"excitedHippo: I agree with you there with the independent statement, however I don't think that one word makes him an asshole.",False

excitedHippo: And he is helping her by giving her the resources to learn an invaluable language.,False
livelyGiraffe: Yeah. Once in a while. Not with everything. I can see why he was annoyed. ,False
livelyGiraffe: Agree with excitedHippo ,False
eagerOtter: I think it's likely the mother won't use those resources however ,False
"inspiredGorilla: it's an emotional response, he just feels overwhelmed, but what happens when he's not around to help? it would be good for the mother in law to lean on others less",False
fulfilledDolphin: One thing to take into consideration is the ability to learn as well. It can be very overwhelming for people that are older and difficult to do. ,False
"delightedHorse: Yes she seems very stubborn but he was just pretty much venting his frustrations which does not mean he's an asshole, an asshole would be someone who refused to help and called her a nuisance",False
livelyGiraffe: eagerOtter of course not. Why would she when she has someone she can run to every time she needs something already ? Being sarcastic btw. And totally agree with you. ,False
"inspiredGorilla: absolutely, its a delicate issue, very emotional to make big adjustments",False
eagerOtter: I think he should have asked for his family to help more,False
eagerOtter: I agree that helping all the time like the last situation is too much,False
livelyGiraffe: She needs to be more independent ,False
fulfilledDolphin: Talking to family would have ben a great choice. Confiding in his wife first and working together to help the situation. ,False
eagerOtter: I think it's very unlikely at her age that she will take the time to learn a new language ,False
excitedHippo: My overall conclusion is that he is not an asshole. He gave her resources and offered to help her learn something that will really help her and make her less dependent on others. He never insulted her either.,False
fulfilledDolphin: He should have talked to his wife about his frustrations and worked with her on a solution instead of making mother-in-law feeling put out. ,False
excitedBear: We discuss here,False
excitedBear: I will start by saying I do NOT think this person is an asshole.,False
"brightOtter: Considering the son's partner is capable of speaking English, I think it's inconsiderate to only speak French knowing their mother in law cannot understand. ",False
excitedBear: Exactly. I agree,False
inspiredBison: Couldn't she have just asked them to speak English?,False
"excitedBear: They might not have realized it was rude, but I think the fact that he stormed off after she asked them to speak English is an overreaction",False
excitedBear: She did,False
inquisitiveHorse: This could be written by his father too,False
"novelCamel: I think the mom is being an asshole.  If they wanted to include her in the conversation then they would speak in English, clearly they didnt want her in the conversation at that time.  ",False
inspiredBison: He just left the room. That isn't exactly storming off. I think they were just talking naturally and didn't realize it would bother her.,False
"livelyElephant: It is definitely a rude gesture, but I don't think that he is an asshole. ",False
"excitedBear: The inlaw is allowing them to stay in their home, presuming for free. If they don't want to include him/her, then speak about whatever that is at another time",False
"brightOtter: I think the parent probably could have brought up the situation in a nicer way, but they're right in being annoyed by it in my opinion ",False
inspiredBison: I agree brightOtter,False
brightOtter: The son and his partner could easily just speak French when alone together ,False
inquisitiveHorse: Yeah its definitely borderline.  Really depends on the tone and feel of what happened which is hard to guess from the narrative.,False
novelCamel: I dont think just because you are allowing someone to stay in your home that it means that they have to be included in every conversation...,False
"excitedBear: Exactly. And if they're talking about something they don't want to discuss with him/her, it's even more rude tbh",False
"excitedBear: Including in every conversation is one thing, but if they're constantly in the same room and constantly leaving them out, that's another thing",False
livelyElephant: They might have been having a private conversation and did not think about including anyone though.  But he did react a little childish to her calling him out on it.,False
inquisitiveHorse: I tend to agree that the parent (mother or father) was unnecessarily left out.  And it leans toward rude on the son and husband's part.,False
"excitedBear: If it was a one-off situation, sure, but it sounds like this was constant.",False
"brightOtter: You shouldn't have to be included in every conversation just because you're allowing someone to stay with you, but consideration and common sense should be used. The partner and son are outright excluding the parent completely",False
"inspiredBison: If this is the normal way that they communicate with each other, then I think it was just natural. I don't think they were intentionally trying to keep her from listening.",False
excitedBear: Agreed. I think the overreaction from the partner is uncalled for.,False
novelCamel: I think the man was probably just more comfortable speaking his own language and maybe didnt even think anything of it,False
livelyElephant: So who are we deciding is an asshole or not?  The mom or the partner?,False
excitedBear: I think the son and partner are.,False
"inspiredBison: While it would be frustrating to not understand them, I don't think I would get mad. I would just ask them to speak English.",False
excitedBear: Although barely lol,False
inquisitiveHorse: mom or father.  we don't know the gender of the narrator!,False
excitedBear: I voted no.,False
"brightOtter: I don't think the parent is the asshole. If i was staying in someone's home I would make an effort to include them in conversation, and speak in the language they are most comfortable in using as it's their home",False
inquisitiveHorse: Same.  ,False
"novelCamel: I voted yes because I think the parent overreacted, there was no ill will",False
"excitedBear: Yeah, I've been the partner staying with parents. I'm always trying to be respectful and nice.",False
livelyElephant: Ok.  So I don't think the parent is an asshole either.,False
inspiredBison: I think they weren't thinking about how it looked and just acting naturally. I think the mother could have easily mentioned that she didn't understand. She instead acted rude. I think the mom was the asshole,False
"delightedBison: How hard is it to warn your mother that your partner is self-conscious about his accent, etc?",False
novelElephant: I do not this she is being an asshole,False
delightedBison: I think they're all assholes.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I think he should explain how his boyfriend feels to his mother. I am sure she could reassure him that they wouldn't judge him.,False
curiousBear: I do not think that the son is being an asshole but they should have discussed this beforehand.,False
"novelElephant: She is doing what is best for her and her partner, and that is not being an asshole.  She can catch her mother up at any time in English.",False
"eagerZebra: Exactly, the scenario does not say he told his mother about his husband's discomfort.",False
"delightedBison: Yeah, it just doesn't seem like something that should have been an issue, considering it was a previously-addressed issue.",False
novelElephant: Or she can translate while they are talking so her mother feels included.,False
eagerZebra: If he explained to his mother and she still insists it is a different matter.  But it doesnt say he did.,False
"livelyHippo: Although I think the child has no ill will towards the mother in this situation, I think they should have just told the mother about the husband being uncomfortable. ",False
delightedBison: Yes. Communication is key.,False
curiousBear: I understand wanting your partner feeling comfortable being in your parent's house so if they all would have discussed this this would not be an issue at all.,False
novelElephant: yes they should have just communicated better,False
livelyHippo: It's the difference between someone being uncomfortable vs someone being completely excluded. One is better than the other,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: If he didn't speak any English I would understand, but he does speak English. I think she would understand if he messed up.",False
novelElephant: nobody is being an asshole on purpose,False
"delightedBison: I I think ""asshole"" is a strong word, but the lack of comminication sorta makes them the ""bad guy""",False
"delightedBison: Exactly, no one is being an asshole on purpose.",False
livelyHippo: Intent isn't what were debating though either. We're talking about actions ,False
eagerZebra: Agreed.  He is the asshole because he just needed to communicate and set expectations instead of letting his mother - who is being kind enough to host them - feel excluded.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: To automatically not consider your mother's situation is rude. ,False
"delightedBison: Actionwise, I guess.yes. Asshole.",False
inquisitiveMonkey: I think this could have easily been taken care of if the son talked with his mother and spouse. ,False
"delightedBison: Yep. And if the spouse really wanted to talk in German, translate for your mother.",False
eagerZebra: yep,False
livelyHippo: I think if the partner spoke no english it would be more up for debate. But at the end of the day you're completely excluding your parent (whose home you're staying at) ,False
delightedBison: She is being nice enough to host and cook. She misses you. Include her.,False
curiousBear: I don't think speaking in his partner's native language makes you an asshole. ,False
"livelyHippo: Exactly, the spouse could help with the whole ""not knowing the right word"" ",False
inquisitiveMonkey: If they are in a realtionship the mother will never get to know him if they aren't able to communicate. ,False
delightedBison: But it's not the mother staying with THEM. She's hosting them and she's being excluded.,False
"novelElephant: I also think that the parent seems a little insecure and there is a bit of a power struggle going on, but thats just an opinion",False
"eagerZebra: Possibly, but she is hosting them and they are the guests and they should try to be polite and considerate to her foremost while in her home.",False
"novelElephant: and maybe thats why that parent is so ""hurt"" about this",False
livelyHippo: You're still excluding someone needlessly ,False
"delightedBison: Yep. Even if he could ONLY speak German, you'd still want to include mom by translating.",False
"livelyHippo: Is it better to make sure someone is 100% comfortable or exclude someone else completely? Because, for me, exclusion is worse than making someone uncomfortable",False
inquisitiveMonkey: It would be hard for the mother to get to know him without communication. Even bad English would help them to get to know each other and feel comfortable. ,False
delightedBison: I'll be voting asshole. lol,False
livelyHippo: I'll be voting asshole as well ,False
eagerZebra: I'm voting asshole as well.,False
novelElephant: I'll be voting not asshole,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: I agree, asshole",False
eagerZebra: Unless her cooking is really bad.  ,False
eagerZebra: Then maybe mom has it coming.,False
delightedBison: He's german. What is he judging? hahahah,False
curiousBear: I think the more you guys talk about it I will be going with asshole because there are factors that would have fixed. it.  Noncommunication makes him an asshole.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: You need to make an effort with your spouses parents.,False
novelElephant: everyone is entitle to speak in the language they feel most comfortable,False
eagerZebra: as long as it's english.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: Their entitled but it's rude,False
eagerZebra: (again just kidding),False
"curiousMonkey: while i think its okay to help the parents with translation, it would get annoying to always be doing it",False
openGiraffe: I am wondering how many times per week she calls,False
brightHippo: It would probably be annoying but he knew the situation when he got with her.,False
curiousMonkey: right,False
"openGiraffe: If it's not many times, I don't see it as an issue.",False
"fulfilledBear: I believe it is ok to help the parents but he should not be expected to do all the work, so yes I believe she is an asshole.",False
excitedElephant: She works and is working on her master's. What does he do?,False
curiousMonkey: while they are married he probably cant relate to what they went through to get to where they are,False
"novelGorilla: It would be annoying, but she has a lot on her plate as is. I don't think it's that big of an inconvenience to help out. I mean you married this girl, help her out by helping out her parents.",False
"delightedCamel: I don't think she is an asshole just for asking her husband for help, however if it is becoming every time she calls she expects him to drop what he is doing and translate that could get very annoying.",False
fulfilledBear: the burden should not be solely non him unless he has agreed to take on that burden.,False
"openGiraffe: She won't be working on her master's forever, maybe they can make a compromise that after she isn't as busy, she can pick up some of the phone calls",False
excitedElephant: Marriage partners are a team. He should help out if she os overwhelmed\,False
"novelGorilla: You assume some ""burdens"" when you marry someone.",False
curiousMonkey: i think her parents may call often,False
curiousMonkey: a lot of immigrant families talk daily,False
"excitedElephant: I agree, open open openGiraffe",False
"delightedCamel: It is also probably more of a burden on him than it would be on her, being that she is a native speaker and it is his second language.",False
brightHippo: But he kind of has agreed to it if he's been helping out with translating for them all this time. He can't just decide he doesn't like doing it anymore because it's annoying him.,False
excitedElephant: ir=ts temporary,False
"fulfilledBear: they are a tea, but there should not be an expectation that he needs to be the translator, she needs to also step up.",False
novelGorilla: They could compromise and take turns,False
fulfilledBear: i agree,False
openGiraffe: Yeah I think they could compromise,False
openGiraffe: But I don't think shes an asshole,False
fulfilledBear: he needs to have a discussion with her and agree on sharing the responsibility,False
excitedElephant: I wonder if she asked him or just expects it. He might resent if its just an expectation.,False
curiousMonkey: yea i dont think she's an asshole,False
novelGorilla: So I don't think she's an asshole assuming she agrees to a compromise,False
brightHippo: She should let her mom know that it's not ok to go straight to calling him maybe but I don't think that makes her the asshole.,False
"excitedElephant: Agreed, not an asshole. Possibly needs a better approach",False
delightedCamel: Yes I also think she needs to talk to her parents about calling him.,False
fulfilledBear: I agree that she needs to speak with the mom and moderate the calls,False
"fulfilledBear: yes, I considered both sides",False
"novelGorilla: Yes, both sides have been considered. She is not an asshole.",False
"openGiraffe: Yeah, there is a lot of things left out we don't know, but based on the information given, I don't think she is the asshole, she is just overwhelmed with school. She is not the asshole.",False
"excitedElephant: She says the calls are ""once in a while."" We need more info. To me, that would be oncce a month or so.",False
brightHippo: I have considered both sides and I don't think she's the asshole. ,False
fulfilledBear: I still think she is being an asshole because she is assuming that he needs to take care of this without discussing with him,False
"curiousMonkey: She probably thinks her husband should be more of a team player, so they should have a conversation and compromise but she isn't an asshole",False
openGiraffe: But we don't know if she discussed it with him or not,False
novelGorilla: Yeah we don't have all of the information,False
"excitedElephant: I think he should help. Mom is family, after all.",False
openGiraffe: Maybe she did at the beginning and now he is annoyed by it,False
fulfilledBear: it doesn't sound like they have discussed this issue she is just spouting off to tohers,False
excitedElephant: They do need to discuss.,False
delightedCamel: What makes her seem like the asshole is her attitude towards the situation.,False
"openGiraffe: If they discussed already, they need to discuss it again since there are issues",False
fulfilledBear: i agree about that assessment she is the asshole for the situation and it doesn't sound like she is discoing with her huisband,False
"delightedCamel: Yes I agree, she is the asshole.",False
"fulfilledBear: yes, she is the asshole for how she is handling the situation.",False
novelGorilla: I don't think she is an asshole because you assume some inconveniences with a marriage. He should want to help her and her family out. ,False
openGiraffe: I don't think she is an asshole. She needs to have another discussion with him about picking up some slack after her master's is over. But  there is not enough info.,False
"excitedElephant: This person is not an asshole, but she should perhaps moderate her approach and ask rather than tell him.",False
novelGorilla: They should discuss a better alternative that suits both of them though.,False
"fulfilledDolphin: I think he is the asshole, but I also think we",False
inspiredBison: I don't think he is an asshole I think he is frustrated that her mom was passed on to him for handling.,False
fulfilledDolphin: are missing info,False
inquisitiveZebra: i think he is too,False
inquisitiveZebra: his tone of voice in the writing just reads asshole,False
"excitedHippo: His side of the story is a bit different. He wants her to learn, which is reasonable, but he also needs to cut her some slack.",False
"fulfilledDolphin: Sometimes older people don't like to move from tradition, and she may not feel comfortable using an app",False
inspiredBison: his tone is an asshole but I can see he is more frustrated,False
inquisitiveZebra: and he does seem privileged and elitist,False
"lightMonkey: I think he is the asshole, it does not seem like he has discussed his frustrations with his wife before getting angry with her mother",False
"inquisitiveZebra: cant of like, if i can do it, you should be able to also",False
"excitedHippo: He expects her to be fluent in 8 years, but she is older",False
"livelyGorilla: I think he's the asshole. It wasn't his place to tell her to learn English, it should have come from the wife since he doesn't understand how it is to be an immigrant.",False
inquisitiveZebra: although the mother in law is a bit lazy,False
inspiredBison: he needs to discuss with his wife and come to some agreement.,False
"livelyGorilla: Also, English is a hard language to learn. From what I understand it's one of the hardest.",False
inspiredBison: i agree he shouldn't be telling her to learn English.,False
"excitedHippo: I said he was not an asshole, and I don't think he is, but he is more so than she is.",False
"fulfilledDolphin: She also lives in an area with a lot of immigrants, so maybe she is able to converse well there.",False
openOtter: I think this guy is an asshole. Learning a new language is so hard for people.,False
"lightMonkey: I do think he has a point, if you plan to live somewhere it would only make sense to try to learn some of the language. ",False
"fulfilledDolphin: Yeah, just because it was easy for him doesn't mean it will be easy for her",False
excitedHippo: He learned other languages but did not need them to survive. It's different.,False
inspiredBison: She should at least make an attempt to learn the language,False
excitedHippo: She should try to learn,False
livelyGorilla: Who's to say she hasn't already tried to learn?,False
"fulfilledDolphin: Even if she did make an attempt, she would still need him for at least a little while. It takes time to learn a whole new language",False
inspiredBison: He needs to have a discussion with the wife and MIL,False
openOtter: The guy is also an asshole for how he talks to/about his mother in law,False
"excitedHippo: He already had a discussion, now they hate him ",False
"inspiredBison: He also stated he really didn't have that tone, he was respectful ",False
inquisitiveZebra: exactly. He sounds very disrespectful ,False
"excitedHippo: He was respectful in person, though. ",False
"fulfilledDolphin: He should be more patient. Maybe tell her about one of the translating app that can translate voices, and tell her it may be easier than trying to call him.",False
livelyGorilla: He does sound very disrespectful even if he did explain it to her in a polite way.,False
"openOtter: Learning a new language isn't as easy as ""just hurry up and learn our language already""",False
"fulfilledDolphin: There was a lot of different ways to go about it, and I think he did it the wrong way.",False
"inspiredBison: Yes, I considered both sides and believe that he is not an asshole.",False
inquisitiveZebra: based on what he said it doesnt even sound like she calls him too much...he even said she calls if she cant reach another family member,False
fulfilledDolphin: I think he''s the asshole,False
"excitedHippo: It sounds like she calls him at random times, when she is in the store. ",False
inspiredBison: He has a life too,False
"inquisitiveZebra: right, not calling him all the time",False
"lightMonkey: I can see how his frustrations came through in his post venting, but I think he should have had a clearer discussion with his wife before getting angry with her mother",False
fulfilledDolphin: I don't think she is calling him all hours of the day or anything,False
"inquisitiveZebra: I think he's an asshole, although he isnt totally wrong",False
inspiredBison: I agree about the discussion.,False
openOtter: He also married this girl and with that comes responsibilities/burdens to help her/her family,False
excitedHippo: I think both sides are overreacting. There is a middle ground.,False
inspiredBison: He didn't marry to translate for the in laws,False
inspiredBison: there isa middle grounds,False
livelyGorilla: But marrying into a family that he knew to begin with didn't speak English is something that has to be considered. It's not like he didn't know what he was getting into.,False
"fulfilledDolphin: Yeah, he outlined that in his post, that he knew most of his wife's family were immigrants and spoke Spanisg",False
inspiredBison: He didn't know this would be a full time job,False
fulfilledDolphin: Who says it is though?,False
openOtter: It's not like he is translating for her 24/7,False
"excitedHippo: Yes, livelyGorilla he did know what he wass getting into.",False
fulfilledDolphin: exactly,False
inquisitiveZebra: it isnt like she only depends on him...he seems more frustrated that she doesn't know english more so than her calling all the time,False
"lightMonkey: He doesn't say that he thinks it is a full time job, just that it is annoying",False
"excitedHippo: Yes, he is fristrated by what he sees as overreliance on him.",False
openOtter: Yeah he is frustrated she knows English. He taught himself Spanish so he thinks everyone can learn every language as easy as he did. That's definitely NOT the case. He's an asshole.,False
openOtter: doesn't know English*,False
lightMonkey: Yes he is the asshole,False
excitedHippo: He is an asshole. He needs sympathy for her. She's his MIL and he says he loves her.,False
livelyGorilla: He sounds like an asshole to me,False
novelDolphin: Hello what did you guys think of this case?,False
"delightedGiraffe: Hey, I'm siding with NTA considering situation and intent. Translating on demand can be tiresome and it's reasonable to seek a solution to get rid of it",False
openGorilla: i think that he should not have blown up at his mother in law like that. he could have said it in a nicer way and been easier on her. she's an old woman and it's harder for her to understand and learn english than it is for him. ,False
lightMonkey: I believe he is being an asshole. ,False
eagerHorse: I first thought while reading this that I am on the original poster's side because she has been living here for 8 years so she should make an effort.,False
novelDolphin: Yes i am leaning that he is an asshole as well,False
delightedGiraffe: There's not much evidence that OP lashed out to the mom it seems like he's venting,False
delightedGiraffe: Why is OP is asshole?,False
excitedHippo: He is disrespectful and should be happy to help his mother in law. I've heard english is the hardest to learn.,False
delightedGiraffe: Is it unreasonable to seek to minimize on demand calls for translation?,False
eagerHorse: I can see that it would be difficult for her to learn English for sure.,False
novelDolphin: he probably wasn't the only one helping out his MIL,False
"curiousBear: I fee like he could hae tell the mother in law in a nicer way, although i think living in the US for 8years, she should have learn some basic ",False
novelDolphin: they didn't say how much of the time the calls were,False
novelDolphin: it could have been once a month for a couple of minutes or something like that,False
eagerHorse: I do think he could have said it in a nicer way.,False
delightedGiraffe: Did you read the edit? It sounds like OP made a polite request to tell the mother to learn English,False
excitedHippo: I  agree he did have to be so rude.,False
novelDolphin: was this happening every day?,False
eagerHorse: Overall I do not think he is being an asshole because she is relying on him.,False
"delightedGiraffe: Regardless of frequency, OP expresses frustration with the situation and seeks to amend it. He did it in a reasonable fashion",False
lightMonkey: its hard to come to a country and learn there culture and there language. yes its been 8 years but there is no proof that she is not trying to learn. maybe its a confidence issue with her. ,False
delightedGiraffe: If you were in his shoes what would you do?,False
excitedHippo: I dont think asking anybody in anyway to learn english is polite. so considering both side I still think he is an asshole,False
"delightedGiraffe: He didn't demand the mother to instantly know English, he pointed out resources for her",False
lightMonkey: I whould help her learn without an insulting her,False
curiousBear: i also think he is not being an asshole and it could be frustrating having to be the ,False
lightMonkey: not everyone is able to learn from an app,False
delightedGiraffe: He provides multiple resources including in person classes,False
delightedGiraffe: I do not think it is rude to ask someone to learn English,False
novelDolphin: he could have offered to taught her english himself,False
excitedHippo: Ive taking 4 years of spanish and still cant speak or understand it fluently so I can see why she hasnt learned it yet,False
excitedHippo: Yes he is a asshole,False
eagerHorse: I do not think he is being an asshole about it.,False
delightedGiraffe: OP is not asking the mother to become fluent in English,False
lightMonkey: its tough and Im sure she is trying to learn,False
curiousBear: i agreed with delightedGiraffe ,False
delightedGiraffe: The mother is asking for simple translations,False
lightMonkey: yes he is ,False
novelDolphin: it is tough,False
"delightedGiraffe: The mother does not need to become fluent in English to understand simple translations, such as ones you can ask over the phone",False
eagerElephant: he's being disrecptful to her mother. she's an older woman and can't learn as.easy as someone younger might. it doens't take much out of your day to help her out for 10 minutes.,False
"brightHorse: I said the husband's perspective was NTA, but I also see the wife's situation is NTA as well",False
brightHorse: It is reasonable to see both perspectives as NTA,False
openZebra: it's tough,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I think the original poster is being unreasonable forcing him to translate but I can see both sides.,False
brightHorse: openZebra what's tough,False
lightDolphin: i agree with the husband to a certain extend that it is not his responsibility for being a translator for his mother in law. ,False
delightedBear: Well she should have asked her husband before making him the family translator but I understand she doesnt have time. ,False
lightDolphin: And the family being in the US for so long should have learn some ,False
openZebra: i meant the issue is tough because i can see both sides,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I think he should not have a problem with translating especially if he has more time. ,False
excitedGorilla: No hes not the asshole but his husband is he knew what he was marrying into,False
"openZebra: if it's only ten minutes or so, then it shouldn't be that big of a deal",False
inquisitiveMonkey: Initially I thought she was being an asshole.,False
brightHorse: There doesn't have to be an asshole: it's reasonable for the wife to ask her husband for assistance and it's reasonable for the husband to seek ways to solve the problem of getting too many calls,False
"brightHorse: I believe the wife should be able to ask her husband for assistance given the circumstances, but the husband doesn't have to feel obligated/forced into any situation",False
"lightDolphin: I do think the couple should communicate more on the issue since the wife thinks the husband has more free time and had hi dealing with the mom, I feel like she should take some part of it ",False
openZebra: i could see both sides not being an asshole,False
excitedGorilla: your family is first and you should be willing to help them anyway you can even if its as something as small as translating for them,False
inquisitiveMonkey: He should be more understanding but she should also not sign him up for things.,False
delightedBear: I think they both have equal arguments I can see where they are both coming from.,False
openZebra: if family is first shouldn't the daughter be translating more for the mother?,False
brightHorse: Yes I agree,False
brightHorse: No openZebra,False
openZebra: but the son in law is now a part of the family,False
lightDolphin: brightHorse,False
lightDolphin:   ,False
openZebra: so i guess he should help out as well,False

"fulfilledMonkey: However, they are staying in her home, so they could be more respectful and try to accomodate her wishes. ",False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: idk both sides should just work it out. I think that the husband should speak. You also can't be a ""asshole"" in this type of situation.",False
novelBear: I think it's unreasonable to ask for every conversation to be in English. But it's also unreasonable to never speak in English.,False
"curiousOtter: Asshole is definitely a strong word for this. It is inconsiderate to the mom, no doubt.",False
"eagerCamel: maybe it is hard to say he is definitely being an asshole, but it is rude to speak a language not everyone speaks, if all parties can communicate in a certain language",False
"novelBear: I think the mother wants every conversation in English but the daughter wants just some in English, some in German, which is more reasonable.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: Yes if she can't speak a lick of German and the husband can speak some English, this is a great opportunity for him to practice English and make mom happy!",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: The husband should just deal with it for a little,False
eagerCamel: That is a good point to see it as an opportunity to practice English,False
"curiousOtter: They're with the mom for one weekend, the couple will be together for the foreseeable future. They should make the mom happy for the time being.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: He definitely doesn't seem like TA, but I do think they could make more of an effort to speak English around mom. ",False
fulfilledMonkey: They can always speak German when in private and English around mom. ,False
"eagerCamel: There is definitely no reason not to speak German in their own conversations, but should speak English with the mother",False
"curiousOtter: I'm going to pick asshole, because above all the mom is the host so they should respect her wishes if they're reasonable. ",False
"fulfilledMonkey: I vote he is inconsiderate, but not TA. ",False
eagerCamel: I agree since a choice has to be made I'd say asshole because it is rude to her when she is being accomodating to them,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: She sounds reasonable, the daughter can simply say no, I'd rather not.",False
curiousHippo: Are we asking if the mom is the asshole or the son?,False
"openCamel: It does seem to me if everyone can speak English, but the mother can't speak French, if they are all together they should speak English",False
openCamel: the mom,False
"lightMonkey: Yeah this one seems pretty simple, I don't see anything asshole-ish about asking your guests to speak your language in front of you if they're able to.",False
"curiousHippo: Ok, I don't think the mom is the asshole here at all then. ",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I think the daughter can say no if she wants to, but that doesn't make the mom an asshole",False
"curiousHippo: If they can all speak English, then they should respect the host. ",False
"openCamel: It might have been more constructive to just start a conversation in English instead of calling them disrespectful, but it does seem the son was being rude",False
"curiousHippo: I agree...she's allowed to make her own choices, but that hardly makes mom the bad guy here. ",False
curiousHippo: I think she just wants to be part of the conversation. ,False
livelyZebra: Yes this person is such an asshole.,False
livelyZebra: Why would you be so mean to someone that doesn't know English. It is not like you would talk shit about your own person.,False
openCamel: It sounds like we all agree the mom was completely within her rights,False
"curiousHippo: Well according to what she said, he does speak English. He just chose not to. ",False
curiousHippo: I believe the mom was not TA in this situation. ,False
"lightMonkey: The way I look at it, if you're letting someone stay at your house you'd have to be pretty darn rude to be considered an asshole. This isn't even close to that.",False
"openCamel: I agree the mom just wanted to be included, plus was being hospitable to them",False
"inspiredGiraffe: I'm thinking that OP probably isn't speaking german 100% of the time, it sounds like she's asking him not to speak it at all which seems kinda mean",False
"curiousOtter: I think she's not an asshole, but she could have been more helpful to her husband and to her mom.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: I don't think the guy is an asshole, he is being rude though by excluding his mother. But that doesn't necessarily make him an asshole as he's doing it to make his husband more comfortable",False
eagerCamel: This guy's not an asshole by any stretch of the imagination: he just got married and his mother's expecting his partner to have picked up English to a conversational level,False
excitedElephant: It seems unfair of the writer to choose to speak German when his mom can understand none of the conversation but his spouse could understand at least some of the conversation if they were speaking English,False
inquisitiveBear: It's the mother's home and she is being excluded. The husband can speak English but gets nervous. The mother can't speak German at all though. ,False
"excitedElephant: Plus, his mom is graciously hosting them. It seems rude to be to exclude her. ",False
inspiredGiraffe: Wouldn't mom just need to ask what they're talking about tho?,False
fulfilledMonkey: But is he being an asshole? I still say no. Just a rude SOB ,False
curiousOtter: It is rather rude to speak German in the mother's house when she doesn't speak it.,False
"fulfilledMonkey: The husband speaks English too, so they can all speak English",False
eagerCamel: Yeah it may be rude but its not assholish,False
inspiredGiraffe: they 99% aren't likely talking shit about mom,False
inspiredGiraffe: but not to a conversational level,False
curiousOtter: The Mom and child could both help him with his English to make him more comfortable.,False
excitedElephant: THere seems to be little compromise here. The newlyweds could always have their private conversations in German and speak English when mom is around. ,False
fulfilledMonkey: exactly excitedElephant,False
"inspiredGiraffe: Yeah, and even a little german when mom is around should be fine IMO",False
inspiredGiraffe: she shouldn't have to know every single thing,False
eagerCamel: Or the guy can spend some time with his mother apart to relate all that's happened,False
inspiredGiraffe: Definitely,False
eagerCamel: I may not be married but even I know spouses arent joined at the hip,False
"curiousOtter: I think they're being rude to the Mother, but not necessarily an asshole.",False
inspiredGiraffe: so I think we all agree NTA?,False
"excitedElephant: Besides, what a great way to learn conversational English that he might not be familiar with....with his new spouse and mother in law. That's as non judgemental of a crowd as you can find. ",False
"excitedElephant: I agree, NTA. Just kinda rude. ",False
fulfilledMonkey: Yeah NTA. There's no asshole here,False
"curiousOtter: Yes, NTA",False
"eagerCamel: Ehhh mother in laws can be a tough crowd, especially for a M/M pair",False
"eagerCamel: still, no assholes here",False
"excitedElephant: True, eagerCamel though there's nothing in the writing that suggests that's the case here. ",False
eagerCamel: I'm American (25M) and recently married a German guy (23M),False
eagerCamel: thats the first line,False
curiousBison: This AITA feels like it was written by a narcissist,False
livelyZebra: It's her house and his husband speaks English. ,False
novelDolphin: I feel like mainly she was just super rude,False
lightMonkey: I think the mother had a normal reaction as far as being excluded from the conversation. She could have engaged the son-in-law in English conversation instead of being rude though,False
inquisitiveCamel:  might be a bit too much to ask someone who's clearly not comfortable speaking english to speak it. Can't she just chill for a week?,False
"livelyZebra: I think the son in law was the rude one. He can speak English, but chose not to with her in the room.",False
fulfilledHippo: She could have just said something to the son without the partner present. ,False
curiousBison: I've met people like this - no. If people don't behave exactly as they expect they fly off the handle,False
inquisitiveCamel: Maybe because he wants to make his partner more comfortable @Zebra?,False
"livelyZebra: ""My son’s partner is French, but he can speak English, he just has an accent."" Maybe the son-in ",False
"lightMonkey: It is a bit frustrating when people are speaking in a different language and obviously making no attempt to include you, though",False
"livelyZebra: -Maybe the son-in-law is uncomfortable, but she can help him.",False
"inquisitiveCamel: but OP also says he spoke very few english sentences since he got there, that's a pretty good sign he's not good at it",False
curiousBison: There's a difference between being conversational in english and knowing the absolute basics,False
"lightMonkey: The son's partner is just used to speaking French and made little attempt to speak English, knowing the mother doesn't know French. Kind of lazy and rude too",False
lightMonkey: The French are known for being English-phobic lol,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I don't see how that's rude, I imagine it's not like he WANTS to exclude the mom",False
inquisitiveCamel: wow way to stereotype bro,False
fulfilledHippo: They were rude and so was she but nobody was an asshole here. ,False
lightMonkey: I wouldn't call her an asshole,False
livelyZebra: @lightMonkey Agree with being rude and lazy.,False
livelyZebra: I don't think she was being an asshole either. ,False
novelDolphin: I kind of want to call her the asshole in this scenario. She could have approached the conversation a bunch of different ways that would likely have turned out better. ,False
inquisitiveCamel: How is it lazy to not instantly get good at a second language?,False
"lightMonkey: She said he knows English, just has an accent",False
curiousBison: I would-  this person seems like the type to laugh if the partner's english was no good,False
"inquisitiveCamel: Yes, she said that, but I don't think she would be the best judge of that.",False
"inquisitiveCamel: If I hear someone speak one english sentence, should I just assume they ""know"" english?",False
fulfilledHippo: Instead of stomping upstairs he could have just apologized to her and tried to speak a little bit to include her. ,False
"livelyZebra: I'm not sure I know enough about her to know what ""type"" of person she is just from this one situation.",False
lightMonkey: livelyZebra thats more reasonable thinking than most,False
livelyZebra: I think she's not an asshole,False
livelyElephant: Should her mother have to learn english?,False
"novelMonkey: Possibly, but maybe he should have had his wife talk to mother in law",False
brightGorilla: I think the point is he's just tired of being translator. ,False
lightBison: I agree he should not be the translator,False
openGiraffe: I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATION AND I DONT TRANSLATE FOR PEOPLE,True
eagerCamel: I understand his frustration but don't think he should be the one to tell his mother in law that she needs to learn english.,False
"novelMonkey: or possibly said I may not be available all the time when you need me so i will help you learn english, instead of saying it's frustrating",False
"excitedHorse: I think that what he did was realistic and respectful, but it's not an approach that's likely to be interpreted well in the current climate.",False
"brightGorilla: English is one of the hardest languages to learn, so I have sympathy for the mother in law. ",False
novelMonkey: exactly,False
"curiousHippo: ""Have"" to learn English is extreme but be encouraged to learn, perhaps?",False
novelMonkey: I think he,False
openGiraffe: HOW DID HE TELL HER THAT IF SHE CANT SPEAK ENGLIS,True
"excitedHorse: I think since he knew her for 8 years, and loves her, and the family, and has the respect to speak Spanish, she could be encouraged that he would help her with English.",False
curiousHippo: He's bilingual.,False
"novelMonkey: he is right, he just went up about it wrong",False
excitedHorse: Open openGiraffe he speaks fluent Spanish.,False
"eagerCamel: He does seem a little 'braggadocios' though, language does not come easy for everyone and English is particularly hard",False
lightBison: He speaks spanish as well,False
excitedHorse: It sounds like he's willing to help her.,False
openGiraffe: OH YEAH,True
openGiraffe: I FORGOT,True
excitedHorse: If we can all have languages in common we can get along better. ,False
brightGorilla: I don't think he's an asshole... I think the situation itself just sucks ,False
livelyElephant: Yeah I do not know what to say I would not make a good juror between them,False
livelyElephant: I don't think he is racist though,False
excitedHorse: It doesn't mean don't speak other languages.,False
openGiraffe: I REALLY DO THINK SHE SHOULD PUT FORTH SOME EFFORT,True
excitedHorse: I don't think he is racist.,False
eagerCamel: The way he wrote the scenario definitely makes him seem like an asshole - but his edit at the bottom seems more like he didn't say things so cruel.,False
openGiraffe: BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN LEARN THAT MANY LANGUAGES,True
"novelMonkey: This is  tough one, i think he is right to feel the way he does, just took the wrong approach",False
livelyElephant: maybe a little wifeisct,False
excitedHorse: I think if he went to another country he woudl learn the language.,False
eagerCamel: i agree novelMonkey,False
"curiousHippo: Having been in a similar situation, it is an extremely challenging situation.",False
"excitedHorse: It's hard, but she could start with basic phrases.",False
lightBison: after 8 years you should be somewhat familiar with the language,False
brightGorilla: She likely already knows basic phrases after eight years,False
"curiousHippo: But, if it",False
livelyElephant: A racist trump supportor that does hold a lot of weight though,False
excitedHorse: I think we also need to know that there might be a lot more goin on with her than we are aware of.,False
excitedHorse: Past trauam.,False
livelyElephant: I am just kidding,False
excitedHorse: Illness.,False
eagerCamel: i have a feeling she was relying on him so much she felt like she didn't need to learn more.,False
excitedHorse: Unclear what else might be getting in her way.,False
livelyElephant: to many chiefs not enough engines,False
brightGorilla: Can't teach an old dog new tricks ,False
eagerCamel: Older generations can also be stubborn.,False
brightGorilla: how old are they?,False
livelyElephant: I want to be an engine!!!,False
openGiraffe: I DID CONSIDER BOTH SIDES AND MAYBE JUST PUR FORTH SOME EFFORT ON HER SIDE AND MAYBE HE SHOULD TRY TO TEACHJ HER,True
excitedHorse: Or she may expect him to help because he's the husband of her daughter.,False
curiousHippo: If it's not necessary for her to speak English (other than by his demands) what is the concern?,False
lightBison: He said he would teach her,False
livelyElephant: I would tell the judge I have to be excused cause of conflict of interests lol,False
excitedHorse: He is getting called up at random times to help her.  It's not that he doesn't want to help.,False
novelMonkey: I think hispanic cultures are so much more family oriented that she probably doesn't understand why he feels this way,False
excitedHorse: Maybe they could work out a schedule?,False
curiousHippo: Sometimes our elders are set in their ways and not willing to learn new things.,False
eagerCamel: It's a very inconvenient thing for him and she shouldn't 'expect' him to do that for her,False
openGiraffe: HE IS THE CONCERN AND I UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATION,True
livelyElephant: I would always translate for her cause i love her its my woman,False
excitedHorse: I don't think it has to do wtih being family oriented.  Italians are extremely family oriented and they learned English when they came here.,False
livelyElephant: well unless i did not love her then lol,False
livelyElephant: he is an asshole,False
curiousHippo: I think his concern is getting lost in translation.,False
eagerCamel: I feel like he's a slight asshole...but do understand his frustration.,False
lightBison: I believe that is not a asshole his mother n law needs to learn the language,False
livelyElephant: thanks for hanging out with me all of you.. ,False
livelyElephant: I think i can be a asshole sometimes,False
"excitedHorse: I don't think he's an asshole, he just should have approached it differently.  Yes, his concern is getting lost in translation.  So do we think yes or no?",False
livelyElephant: so i am going say if it was me i am an asshole in this case,False
excitedHorse: We're supposed to agree.,False
lightBison: it may seems like he has two wives having to answer to them both,False
"curiousHippo: He is the asshole, if one has to be chosen",False
curiousBear: so now the wife's complaining on reddit? lol ,False
openOtter: I am thinking that these factors are that spanish is her first language,False
"inquisitiveBison: Yes, it's her side of the story.",False
excitedCamel: so what do you guys think?,False
livelyHorse: Yes.  It gives more perspective though.,False
openOtter: I also think it is her Mother,False
brightGiraffe: I dont think the husband should have to take every call and translate,False
"livelyHorse: If she's going to school and he has free time, that's different.",False
excitedCamel: agreed,False
"livelyHorse: If her mom is older, that's different.",False
openOtter: I then am considering that the husband is the head of the household,False
brightGiraffe: i understand she is busy but it is her mom,False
livelyHorse: So now I don't know.,False
"inquisitiveBison: Again, I don't think she's an asshole, but definitely shouldn't expect her husband to answer every time her mom calls",False
openOtter: so she must be the aita,False
inspiredGorilla: It sounds more like a chore for him than a request,False
openOtter: I am just kidding I hate getting into other peoples fights even in a survey,False
"curiousBear: If he has the free time, though ",False
excitedCamel: they do say it's a lot harder to learn new languages the older you are,False
livelyHorse: True. She needs to respect his view on it also.,False
brightGiraffe: They both should translate it shouldn't fall totally on the husband,False
livelyHorse: Seems like they should be able to come to some middle ground.,False
delightedMonkey: SAME AS LAST ONE. NO ONE IS PURELY ALTRUISTIC AND ALSO NO ONE SHOULD EXPECT ANYONE TO DO ANYTYHING BUT WE DO SOMETIMES'. I DO. HAS SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT],False
curiousBear: and english is one of the hardest to learn ,False
openOtter: they both should help their mother ,False
brightGiraffe: i agree they both should help,False
inspiredGorilla: I'm sure that he didn't mind at first but it would make sense that they collectively try to teach her English.,False
livelyHorse: I agree brightGiraffe they should both help.,False
"curiousBear: And take her culture into consideration, elders are to be respected and cared for, not made to do anything. ",False
delightedMonkey: I AGREE ABOUT BOTH. SHE CAN TRANSLATE TOO,False
inquisitiveBison: she should be more considerate of her husband and let her mom know to not take advantage of his help.,False
livelyHorse: So then is is she the a?,False
"excitedCamel: I am sure she does things in their marriage for her husband that she doesn't want to, so i can understand her wanting him to help",False
inspiredGorilla: Learning a new language can be fun too...it shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing,False
openOtter: I say everyone is the A in this case,False
brightGiraffe: she shouldnt assume that her husband married her and signed on to be the family translator,False
inquisitiveBison: she also mentioned making fun of her husband being a 'gringo'...which definitely rubs me the wrong way.,False
openOtter: well except for me of course,False
livelyHorse: openOtter I agree but unfortunately that's not one of the chocies,False
openOtter: ill be Z,False
delightedMonkey: OPEN openOtter LOL AGREED,False
delightedMonkey: I STILL SAY SHE IS THOUGH,False
inspiredGorilla: I think that they equally are frustrated with the fact that translation is necessary and are blaming one another for it,False
livelyHorse: inspiredGorilla,False
livelyHorse: good point,False
excitedCamel: wanting someone to do something and just expecting it are two different things too,False
inquisitiveBison: agreed,False
curiousBear: I don't think anyone's the asshole. gma and gpa just need a retirement home. Problem solved. ,False
openOtter: Ya maybe if she hadnt opened with spanish is her first language implying she speaks it really well but doesnt want to be bothered so she dumps on some poor innnocent guy watching a football game,False
inquisitiveBison: I can see both sides. I just think they have to come to a compromise.,False
livelyHorse: She is really busy though.  ,False
"inspiredGorilla: I think that the ""expectation"" is what is weighing on the husband.",False
openOtter: God bless em both they should kiss and make up,False
brightGiraffe: too busy for conversation,False
livelyHorse: They need to find a compromise and I wish I could work with them on that.,False
livelyHorse: but,False
excitedCamel: its frustrating having to deal with your spouses family sometimes but that is part of being married,False
livelyHorse: we just have to decide,False
livelyHorse: ista,False
inspiredGorilla: Compromise is definitely needed in this scenario.,False
openOtter: he should buy her flowers she should cook him corn bread and black beans light a candle and call it a night,False
"curiousBear: I agree, they need compromise. Designated days to help mom. Designated days to teach mom a bit more english. etc. ",False
livelyHorse: They should both sit down and help gma navigate.,False
openOtter: and that what love is i guess people tell me so,False
delightedMonkey: AGREED AGAIN OPEN openOtter BUT SHE IS STILL THE ASSHOLE,False
brightGiraffe: communication,False
excitedCamel: they should talk to each other instead of reddit,False
inspiredGorilla: I'm sure gma feels like a third wheel as it is,False
"livelyHorse: So sounds like we all agree, ish",False
curiousBear: I don't think she's the asshole either ,False
"inquisitiveBison: I'd say she is the asshole, only because she's mad at him for not doing something she just put on him all together.  He didn't offer to do it.",False
livelyHorse: I think gma may feel deeply loved.,False
livelyHorse: Just confused.,False
brightGiraffe: GMA gained a son and a personal translator,False
delightedMonkey: SHE IS IN MY OPINION,False
livelyHorse: so yes?,False
brightGiraffe: yes,False
"inspiredGorilla: The whole situation is a teachable moment...sit down, as a family, and learn English/Spanish together",False
inspiredGorilla: yes,False
openOtter: ty 8o)),False
inquisitiveBison: i'm saying yes,False
"curiousBear: I can't do a yes. I see frustration, but I don't see anyone acting like a legitimate asshole. ",False
openOtter: for the conversation,False
delightedMonkey: I CANT GO AGAIDSNT WHAT I BELIEVE. AND HE HAS A ;LIFE AS WE;LL,False
inspiredGorilla: She is the ahole.,False
lightBison: It,False
livelyDolphin: What did you guys end up going with? I think they are somewhat justified in their decision as they feel left out and just want to probably get to know their son's partner better. ,False
inquisitiveCamel: I don't think the author made an unreasonable request. ,False
lightBison: It's just rude to speak a foreign language in the presence of nonspeakers when you know the local language.,False
"curiousHorse: My initial impression is that since the dad does not speak French and his son and partner know this, they should speak English to be polite. It would be nice to include him in the conversation.",False
brightGiraffe: well i believe that the son and his partner maybe should of spoke english instead of french. The reason why is because i feel like that does make someone one feel uncomfortable. ,False
"livelyDolphin: I agree. They were all in the same room so I think as long as the dad asked nicely, it was a reasonable request.",False
inquisitiveCamel: Sounds like most of us are in agreement.,False
lightBison: Can we agree that it was a reasonable request to speak English?,False
"curiousHorse: Yes, agreed.",False
inquisitiveCamel: Yep.,False
openMonkey: yes ,False
livelyDolphin: Yeah.,False
brightGiraffe: it’s not polite to speak another language in front of other people that don’t speak their language ,False
lightBison: Yay!,False
brightGiraffe: yes,False
delightedOtter: agree ,False
brightGiraffe: i am agree with you all lol,False
openMonkey: But sometimes the way you convey the message also matters,False
"livelyDolphin: Yeah, as long as he said it in a respectable way and not really harsh.",False
lightBison: From an lightBison to a brightGiraffe thanks!,False
"delightedOtter: She might have handled it better by speaking privately with her son, but I don't think she was an ahole for asking.",False
openMonkey: Finally concluded that the person is not an asshole,False
brightGiraffe: Maybe the son and the partner was talking about something that they didn’t want and the parent to know. ,False
"inquisitiveCamel: Yeah, I think you'd have to have been there to know exactly how it was stated to make a true judgement, but from what information we have available it sounds like they're not the asshole.",False
"livelyDolphin: I would think that'd be okay for the most part, but since they were all hanging out in the same room together, it would off a little rude",False
lightBison: I think that it was a perfectly reasonable request from people who speak multiple languages to accommodate the parties who are not bilingual. ,False
brightGiraffe: but than again they should of told the parent excuse me i am about to speak in french to my partner and i don’t want you to feel uncomfortable but it’s personal ,False
brightGiraffe: I don’t think the son and his partner is an asshole but that’s very rude ,False
openMonkey: The person is not an asshole since his request is reasonable,False
"delightedOtter: While the mother might have handled this better and perhaps overrates her son's partners' English ability, any shortcoming on her part does not rise to the level of being an asshole",False
"inquisitiveHorse: Most Germans learn English from an early age, so it should not be a big leap to speak it in from of American in-laws.",False
brightElephant: I'm considering the fact that the husband specifically said he feels uncomfortable speaking English.,False
livelyGorilla: i think that the son is an asshole because his mom invited him and his partner to her home it’s only right to speak english in front of his mkm,False
livelyGorilla: mom,False
fulfilledOtter: I think that not speaking the language your host understands while spending a weekend with them is wrong.,False
fulfilledOtter: Son is an asshole.,False
livelyGorilla: yes so true ,False
novelCamel: Inviting the person to a conversation is their own choise,False
"delightedGiraffe: I do kinda agree because while his partner can understand English, his mom can't understand German.",False
"inquisitiveHorse: It is so wrong, when he knows English. Uncomfortable is pretty much the rule with inlaws.",False
"brightElephant: On the other hand, I don't think it is unreasonable to make an effort to speak a language that you are familiar with.",False
brightElephant: It's not like its a completely unfamiliar language to him.,False
inquisitiveHorse: Mom is always right.,False
livelyGorilla: yes but the partner understand a little just can’t speak too much english ,False
delightedGiraffe: He did say he spent a good majority of the time speaking German and not so much his family.,False
livelyGorilla: yes that’s true he did that ,False
fulfilledOtter: The son's husband's comfort comes second to the mother being able to catch up with her son over the weekend by talking to him. I don't think she invited them to spend the weekend so that she could just exist in the same room as them.,False
delightedGiraffe: The son should be there to be able to help his partner out if he runs into any English problems,False
inquisitiveHorse: Are we in agreement? I'm with mom.,False
"eagerHippo: It's commendable that the daughter does not want to make her German husband uncomfortable.  Still, it's the mother's house and the son in law should be able to suck it up for a visit ",False
fulfilledOtter: Same. Son's the asshole.,False
delightedGiraffe: I agree.,False
brightElephant: Agreed,False
novelCamel: I dont think son is an asshole,False
fulfilledOtter: Why?,False
livelyGorilla: yes i understand his partner doesn’t understand that much english but he should teach more and also speak english around his mother as well so she won’t feel uncomfortable ,False
novelCamel: He didnt speak German before her mom,False
"inquisitiveHorse: I can see both sides, but the fact that the partner can speak English (albeit awkwardly) makes it evident that he should speak English in the presence of mom. It's just good manners.",False
eagerHippo: good point,False
brightElephant: He said for most of the weekend he spoke German. Why not speak English for at least half of that time? The partner understands it.,False
livelyGorilla: yes he didn’t speak german before his mother ,False
delightedGiraffe: Exactly,False
delightedGiraffe: He said he spent of his time speaking German that weekend he spent at his mother's house,False
inquisitiveHorse: 50-50 sounds about right!,False
fulfilledOtter: They said that he WAS speaking German.,False
livelyGorilla: yes this person is an asshole ,False
eagerHippo: I would still vote asshole,False
novelCamel: I stick on to he is not an asshole,False
livelyGorilla: i would vote asshole too lol,False
"brightElephant: Yes, I vote asshole. He could've come up with a better arrangement (like speaking half English half German)",False
delightedGiraffe: The mom was upset though that she didn't get to speak to him much while he was staying at her house,False
"livelyHorse: Here, the mother was not the asshole",True
openOtter: Definitely,False
eagerZebra: I don't think she was either,False
curiousMonkey: I feel like the women should have told her son her concerns by himself and let him tell his partner later on so his partner would take it better from him,True
livelyHorse: She felt distressful about their language spoken,True
fulfilledElephant: I believe the mother was the asshole. I thinki she could have told her son in private about her concerns before embarrassing the partner,False
openOtter: She claims that she was being excluded because they were talking in another language. But you're not included in all conversations where you do understand the language being spoken!,False
eagerZebra: The son's should not have spoke a different language if they were invited into the mothers home,False
curiousMonkey: I dont think she was a A hole completly i think she could have handled it better ,True
inspiredGiraffe: I agree with fulfilledElephant she should've brought it up privately before making it a public issue,False
"openOtter: A married couple should be able to have a conversation by themselves, whatever the language.",False
livelyHorse: From the mother side we could tell that she also has equal rights,True
livelyHorse: so mother couldn't be an asshole,True
fulfilledElephant: I think she could have handled it better. The partner just might not feel comfortable speaking english as they do french and defaulted to that language,False
"inquisitiveDolphin: I feel like this person is the ""asshole"" in this situation, they know that the partner does not speak much English. She made the encounter about themselves when really she could have talked with her son about her concerns. ",False
fulfilledElephant: She didn't need to call them out like that.,False
openOtter: Do you have the right to insert yourself in every conversation happening in her home,False
"livelyHorse: There they mention the partner was an accent, and can speak English",True
openOtter: I feel like the language is a red herring,False
"eagerZebra: For the guys side, it is their normal language to speak at home",False
"inspiredGiraffe: I think the fact that she brought it up in front of everyone makes her an asshole in and of itself. That, and just because the two are speaking in a different language doesn't mean she has the right to butt in and change that",False
fulfilledElephant: That doesn't mean the partner is 100% comfortable with english,False
fulfilledElephant: from the mothers perspective she may have felt that was good enough to speak it always,False
fulfilledElephant: but this may not be the case,False
inquisitiveDolphin: She could have taken some initiative to break the ice and ask about some french words then explain how she can't understand. The way she brought up her feelings was childish. ,False
"livelyHorse: If it was their personal talk, they could have it personally",True
livelyHorse: not in front of his mother,True
openOtter: She didn't want them to be able to speak in a private conversation. She is nosey and controlling.,False
"eagerZebra: from the guys perspective, maybe the partner is just shy at speaking english",False
curiousMonkey: ANd she did say she told them nicely but she still shoulda pulled him aside in private. ,True
openOtter: Have you never spoken to one person while others are around?,False
"inspiredGiraffe: I can see her side that she feels disrespected possible in her own home, but the thing is, they weren't even necessarily talking to her. They both spoke a different language so it's really no biggy",False
fulfilledElephant: So I think most of us are in agreement that it could have been handled better,False
inspiredGiraffe: I agree,False
eagerZebra: I agree with inspiredGiraffe she's not an asshole but may have just overthought it,False
curiousMonkey: I dont think she was intentionally trying to be a jerk but she did come across that way. ,True
"openOtter: If you were to take out the language part, what would you say if instead the mother was complaining that they weren't speaking loud enough for her to hear?",False
livelyHorse: She is not asshole,True
openOtter: Her complaint is that she couldn't hear and participate in their conversation,False
"inspiredGiraffe: I don't think she's an asshole as a person, but in this excerpt specifically, she was a bit of an ass. so I'd vote yes to her being an asshole",False
livelyHorse: majority was not an asshole,True
"fulfilledElephant: So I think if anyone is an asshole its the mother but only a little, because it could have been handled better and without embarrassment",False
"openOtter: If they weren't talking loud enough to each other for her to hear and join in, then were they being an asshole?",False
curiousMonkey: okay vote,True
openOtter: Yes,False
openOtter: The mother is the asshone,False
openOtter: *The mother is the asshole,False
curiousMonkey: asshole by majority ,True
curiousMonkey: i didnt think she was but its majority ,True
eagerZebra: i dont think so but its majority,False
"livelyHorse: The mother was not an asshole, as she has her rights to ask her son about the language they spoke that was distressful to her",True
curiousMonkey: hurry and vote ,True
livelyGorilla: So...I'm thinking the daughter might be the asshole here but just barely. I can see both sides of this.,False
inquisitiveZebra: My initial impression is that this poster is caught in the middle. She isn't trying to disrespect her mom but she kind of it.,False
excitedHippo: I don’t think this person is an a hole because his reasonings weren’t for selfish intentions he wasn’t purposely trying to keep the mother out of the conversation. ,False
inquisitiveZebra: Only because she should be also spending quality one on one time with her mom,False
novelGiraffe: She might not be an asshole,True
curiousOtter: I dont think he is an asshole,False
livelyGorilla: I think it would have been a better choice to speak German when the mother isn't around,False
livelyGorilla: Like if they're by themselves they can speak it but in front of the mother try for English,False
inquisitiveZebra: The daughter can do a better job of making the mother feel more kept up to date with her life,False
curiousOtter: But I do think they should be more considerate considering they are at his moms,False
inquisitiveZebra: Speak to the mother separately in English!,False
novelGiraffe: The person in the paragraph clearly said that the partner was not comfortable in speaking English,True
inquisitiveZebra: The husband should definitely also be trying a little bit to speak in English to the mother-in-law.,False
"inquisitiveZebra: Even just a few words, I'm sure it would mean a lot to her",False
"eagerBison: I think the OP is an asshole, honestly. They could play both sides and agree to talk to their mother in English more, but they're being super all-or-nothing and only going with their SO.",False
"curiousOtter: Or at least they could explain it to the mother, she should know",False
excitedHippo:  he wHe was just trying to make his husband comfortable but he should have expressed his husbands situation to her so she would understand why they were speaking german,False
novelGiraffe: As the person has their own rights to speak their own language,True
livelyGorilla: I mean if hes not comfortable speaking English maybe he can still understand it and the daughter could just translate,False
inquisitiveZebra: Huh. I didn't think she was an asshole but I agree that it shouldn't be all or nothing,False
curiousOtter: I like liv,False
inquisitiveZebra: And that's another good point that the daughter can translate,False
"inquisitiveZebra: You guys are kind of pulling me to the ""She's an asshole"" side",False
livelyGorilla: I think the daughter is the asshole. She could have taken a more nuanced approach and instead chose the extreme,False
"curiousOtter: I like that point, it would include all of them in the conversation",False
"eagerBison: Like there's no communication here. The OP is going all the way in with their SO but his/her parents love them and they can 1) translate for both sides and 2) talk to the parents in English, it's not hard. It's just talking.",False
excitedHippo: Yeah its true they could have translated good point,False
inquisitiveZebra: The daughter should translate,False
curiousOtter: eagerBison has a point they should have put in the effort more if staying with the parents,False
livelyGorilla: Like if she cared about her mom being happy too she could have found a compromise,False
curiousOtter: From the mom's side she just wants to hear how they are doing,False
inquisitiveZebra: Are you guys thinking that she's an asshole now?,False
inquisitiveZebra: I kind of am.,False
livelyGorilla: I think she is,False
excitedHippo: Yeah she kinda did just decide to choose the husband over the moms feelings,False
inquisitiveZebra: Anyone else? What are you thinking?,False
eagerBison: Yes I think OP is being a bit of an ass,False
curiousOtter: Eh I think she is but not a super big asshole,False
"novelGiraffe: The persona was an asshole, as a human, they have their own rights to do whatever they want and can do according to the situation",True
inquisitiveZebra: What do you guys think about this situation compared to the previous one?,False
excitedHippo: i think the last situation was worse,False
"inquisitiveZebra: Because we thought that they weren't the asshole, yet here are mostly thinking that she is",False
novelGiraffe: Not an asshole,True
"eagerBison: Sure, as a human you can do what you want. But you're still an asshole for doing certain things",False
livelyGorilla: I think they're similar but we can only work with the info we're given by the narrator,False
curiousOtter: pretty much the same I think,False
"livelyGorilla: I think the daughter could have found a better compromise, she's the asshole here",False
excitedHippo: but u guys said they were an a hole for confronting the differnt language and now ur saying they are an asshole for speaking the language ,False
"novelGiraffe: The persona was an asshole, as a human, they have their own rights to do whatever they want and can do according to the situation",True
"curiousOtter: Conclusion, I think she is an asshole, they could have communicated better between all of them",False
excitedHippo: okay so yes to asshole then,False
"inquisitiveZebra: The daughter is an asshole, not in the general sense of the word, but if we have to assign blame I think it's her. She didn't try very hard and is acting helpless when there were other options she could take to remedy the situation.",False
inquisitiveZebra: All in favor of asshole? Say ay!,False
livelyGorilla: I felt the mom was an asshole i nthe last one because she could have brought it up better.,False
livelyGorilla: Not because she wanted to be included,False
eagerBison: That's the experiment I suppose,False
"inspiredHorse: I don't think the man is an asshole, and he's definitely in a tough situation.",False
lightCamel: I am thinking the author is not the asshole.  If he has a job & the mother is calling him while he is working to get translation assistance his job could be at risk.,False
inspiredHorse: He has created the expectation that he'll be available whenever his MIL needs him.,False
"livelyGiraffe: I think the same, he is not an a-hole. It can be tough to be the designated translator.",False
"curiousZebra: But Old people needs more time learn things. They have many difficulties with their health , feelings too",False
lightCamel: I also considered that she has been here 8 years.  I don't think I could go 8 years where I would need someone to translate for me all of the time.  I would not like to be that dependent upon others.,False
openGorilla: It's also different when you're coming from one country to another,False
"inspiredHorse: He has every right to change that expectation, but he can't dictate what his MIL does.",False
"livelyGiraffe: It depends on how old she actually is. And still, an effort should be made.",False
lightCamel: Yes - I agree she needs to make an effort.,False
"inspiredHorse: He can only control what he does, like not dropping whatever he's doing to accommodate his MIL. Eventually, she'll catch on.",False
"openGorilla: Yeah, I do agree that an effort should be made. Age would play a huge factor in this ",False
"livelyGiraffe: I'm sure he was trying to be helpful in the beginning, but he became a crutch.",False
openGorilla: She did start to depend on him too much ,False
curiousZebra: Man should handle this in a polite way,False
novelElephant: I think it's reasonable to expect her to have started at least taking classes or following guides to learn spanish herself. He can help but shouldn't have to a full-on translator all the time.,False
openGorilla: I definitely agree with that. He sounded very hostile ,False
"livelyGiraffe: It's hard when the whole family is against you and you've not done anything wrong, really.",False
"inspiredHorse: The MIL likely doesn't feel the need to learn English, since everyone in her family and neighborhood speaks Spanish.",False
lightCamel: It is sad that the whole family has turned against him.  ,False
curiousZebra: she can learn english by watching English cartoons,False
curiousZebra: or they can use translator tool,False
lightCamel: I can only imagine the cringe he feels when he sees her number on the phone because he knows she is looking for him to translate.,False
"novelElephant: Yeah, start with baby steps to learn. Some effort at least.",False
"inspiredHorse: Maybe it would have been received better if he spoke to his daughter, and asked her to speak with her mother.",False
"livelyGiraffe: I think his hostility was his frustration, and he did clarify that he was polite with the MIL",False
curiousZebra: Yes This person is a asshole,False
"livelyGiraffe: No, not an asshole",False
curiousZebra: Its insult she never forget till death,False
"inspiredHorse: As I said earlier, I don't think he is an asshole.",False
curiousZebra: yes,False
eagerGiraffe: My initial impression is that the the author is the asshole.,False
"livelyMonkey: The woman summarized her post by asking, ""AITA for making my husband translate stuff for my mom?"" I think she answered her own question.",False
"lightGorilla: While technically she is the a-hole in the situation, I think it's more about expectations and assumptions.",False
"livelyMonkey: She is not an asshole for wanting her husband's help, but is she for assuming he's willing to keep giving it.",False
"eagerGiraffe: I base this on her expecting her husband to be available whenever her mother needs a translation.  Also, for her being mad that he suggested her parents learn English.",False
"inspiredDolphin: The woman should know their limits , she is distrubing lot",False
novelOtter: She did mention that he does have more free time than her ,False
livelyMonkey: Her family is NOT his family; she has more responsibility to them than he does.,False
"inspiredDolphin: She should use the technology to translate, google translate",False
lightGorilla: The expectation that just because he married into the family automatically makes him responsible is alot to put on someone,False
"eagerGiraffe: I agree livelyMonkey - they are the authors family, not her husband's.  Even though you gain your spouse's family there still has to be some boundaries.",False
inspiredDolphin: We should live independently. This happens to everyone when we depend things on other person.,False
eagerGiraffe: And is the author assuming her husband has more free time because she is working on a degree?  What responsibilities does he have?  Is mother-in-law calling him when he is otherwise occupied expecting a translation?,False
"livelyMonkey: Definitely, eagerGiraffe. If she sounded more appreciative than expectant, her husband might not be as bothered.",False
"lightGorilla: While it's hard not to feel comfortable in the language, efforts should be made. Then people are more willing to help if efforts are made",False
inspiredDolphin: Using the technology solves this problem.,False
lightGorilla: Very good points,False
"livelyMonkey: In summary, I think she's the asshole in this scenario.",False
eagerGiraffe: Yes -technology has provide a lot of new options in translation than were available even 10 years ago.,False
lightGorilla: Technology is good but only if you know how to use it,False
"novelOtter: Yeah I agree, we don't know how old she is either, so maybe she doesn't know how to use it. ",False
inspiredDolphin: Even siri and ok google do that,False
"lightGorilla: Yes, she is the a-hole due to expectations placed on the hubby",False
eagerGiraffe: In conclusion I think the author is an asshole for expecting her husband to be available at anytime to translate for her mother.,False
inspiredDolphin: Woman should not depend not anyone. she should start using the technology,False
inspiredDolphin: she is not an asshole,False
"lightHippo: So, what did you all think?",False
livelyDolphin: my initial impression is that this person's an asshole. or at least being a bit unreasonable,False
lightHippo: I don't really know how to side on this one.,False
curiousZebra: I think she's right it is rude toexclude someone,False
"fulfilledHorse: Yes, I thought they were being very unreasonable",False
fulfilledHorse: Although more information would've been nice,False
"delightedBison: She could have been much more reasonable, and sat down to engage in a conversation.",False
"livelyDolphin: he might speak english, but it might make him uncomfortable, or he may not be very good at it",False
livelyDolphin: it's just a week,False
inspiredCamel: I am thinking that the person is an asshole. The other party does not know much English so she probably made him uncomfortable.,False
"curiousZebra: I've been in this situation myself, you feel like wallpaper",False
"livelyDolphin: where you were the french person, so to speak?",False
fulfilledHorse: I took it that it was just some conversation between the couple and it was easier to be spoken in french,False
inspiredCamel: I am sure that the other person feels the same way when they are speaking in English. ,False
curiousZebra: no i was the american,False
"lightHippo: I thought she had a point since they were all together but they chose to speak a language she can't understand. However, like livelyDolphin said, he may have been self-conscious about his English ",False
delightedBison: Insecure people tend to think that people are talking about them when they can't understand what is being said. ,False
"inquisitiveElephant: I believe it's certainly more comfortable and easier to speak in your native tongue, but if you know how to speak the language of your host and you don't *on purpose* you are being rude! I don't think he is an asshole",False
brightBear: I believe is disrespectful to have someone else speaking an entirely foreign language in your own house.,False
"lightHippo: Or they may have been talking about private stuff, like bedroom preferences, which doesn't include her",False
inquisitiveElephant: If they wanted a private conversation they could have gone to the bedroom and not completely excluded him from the narrative,False
fulfilledHorse: No information on whether her son offered to translate or anything. Too little information given. They just seemed offended.,False
inspiredCamel: She should have asked what they were talking about before calling them out or being rude about it. ,False
lightHippo: I still can't decide one way or another. ,False
"livelyDolphin: they could definitely do more in trying to include her, I will agree.",False
livelyDolphin: Explian what they're talking about if it's something difficult for the french guy to say in english,False
lightHippo: I think that's a fair point. The first thing she did was default to accusations.,False
fulfilledHorse: I think both sides could be more understanding.,False
delightedBison: She could ask her son to translate,False
livelyDolphin: agreed,False
fulfilledHorse: I think that's a fair request.,False
"lightHippo: Alright, if I had to choose between one or the other, I'll say OP is the asshole.",False
livelyDolphin: she could have definitely approached it differently,False
delightedBison: Asshole,False
inspiredCamel: I defiantly agree that the Op is an asshole. ,False
fulfilledHorse: Agree. Asshole.,False
livelyDolphin: asshole,False
curiousZebra: It says in the writeup that the son's partner can speak English just with an accent. There is no reason for the two men to exclude her,False
"curiousZebra: I disagree, not an asshole",False
livelyDolphin: agreed. but she went about it wrong,False
inquisitiveElephant: It is stated he knows english and he won't speak it because he doesnt want to,False
brightBear: not an asshole to me,False
excitedOtter: Yes she could have asked someone to tell her a paraphrase of what was being said when people paused the conversation then that gives a cue to someone to volunteer to make sure she stays in the conversation,False
lightHippo: What if they were talking about something like what they do in the bedroom or a private medical condition?,False
excitedOtter: yes she is the asshole,False
livelyDolphin: it said they were doing it all week,False
livelyDolphin: and the french guy rarely ever spoke english,False
livelyDolphin: so,False
livelyDolphin: it's probably not that,False
inquisitiveElephant: if it's something private do it in the bedroom,False
"lightHippo: ESH, everyone sucks here, but I think OP was erring on the wrong side",False
inquisitiveElephant: don't do it in front of someone,False
brightBear: They should have saved all private conversations for another time,False
inspiredCamel: I still think she is an asshole for being rude about it. ,False
fulfilledHorse: It said they were staying for a week,False
"delightedBison: Every convo all week was not ""private"". ",False
livelyBison: I thought OP was the asshole.,False
livelyBison: Thoughts?,False
inspiredHippo: same but also not same,False
eagerMonkey: Yes I agree ,False
openCamel: I feel she was a bit of an asshole here because she could've offered to translate for her mother.,False
inspiredHippo: I think he should have done more to try and encourage his SO to participate in english instead of german,False
novelDolphin: I think the person in this story was the asshole.,False
delightedHorse: This one is not that clear cut to me. She's kind of an ahole but not completely,False
"livelyBison: I understand the German partner was uncomfortable with English, but they could've put in a bit more effort into practicing.",False
inspiredHippo: yeah I think kind of an asshole is fair,False
openCamel: \She could've done things to make both her husband and her mother feel more at ease.,False
inquisitiveZebra: There is a middle ground between including mom and making husband comfortable. ,False
"fulfilledOtter: I also feel like she was the asshole. She was only staying there for one weekend, she could have afforded to make the husband uncomfortable for one weekend",False
inspiredHippo: it's tough to definitively say anyone is a cut and dry asshole,False
"livelyBison: Heck, even with broken English, I think the mother would've still been appreciative.",False
inspiredHippo: but we have to so I'm going with asshole,False
livelyBison: Anyone with dissenting opinions?,False
"eagerMonkey: He could have explained to his partner that since it was a long time since seeing his mom, he might spend more time talking to her and that he shoud not take it personally they have a lot to talk about on the trip home",False
delightedHorse: reluctantly she's an ahole,False
"inquisitiveZebra: Mom opened home and hosting, and kid choses to exclude mom. Kid is an asshole.",False
"fulfilledOtter: I feel broken-hearted for this mother who was left out by the daughter because the son-in-law wouldnt even try to speak english. Hell, I feel like he's the asshole here",False
lightGiraffe: This was way harder I almost feel like everyone is at fault. There was such a lack of explanation on all parties sides. ,False
eagerMonkey: at the same time he would tell his mom he would paraphrase their conversation in german so hs partner doesnt feel left out,False
"openCamel: Why not speak English to the mother, German to the husband and then just translate whatever the mother wanted to know? Instead she just let her mom not know what was going on. Seemed a little cold.",False
fulfilledOtter: Partner is the asshole,False
livelyBison: Even if the partner just spoke German and OP translated to English would've been fine,False
openCamel: Exactly,False
livelyBison: Since he supposedly understood English,False
novelDolphin: They should have considered the mom in this situation,False
livelyBison: OP wouldn't have had to translate back to him,False
lightGiraffe: I agree with that. Someone could have translated to help every one feel as if they were involved. ,False
eagerMonkey: Too bad it doesnt say if the partner made any other effort that doesnt require speaking to show respect to the mom when they met like giving her flowers,False
livelyBison: Unless there was a word or two he was unfamiliar with,False
delightedHorse: this line of thinking makes a lot of sense,False
eagerMonkey: Maybe that was why she felt left out in her own home,False
"livelyBison: Heck, the translating to English might've made him more comfortable trying.",False
fulfilledOtter: Poor mom...,False
"inquisitiveZebra: The husband may be uncomfortable, but the mom is hosting him in her home. He could put forth some effort, even if it is uncomfortable. I am sure mom feels hurt and left out. ",False
lightGiraffe: Even then maybe he could have asked for clarification. Its a catch 22 though because not everyone is going to be happy. ,False
openCamel: I think it's the least they could do since the mother was trying to make them feel at home,False
livelyBison: Agreed,False
inspiredHippo: poooor mom ... :(,False
fulfilledOtter: And it was only for the weekend.. They could have tried harder,False
"livelyBison: Partner, and by extension OP, is an asshole in this situation.",False
inspiredHippo: guilty as charged,False
inspiredHippo: op is asshole,False
inquisitiveZebra: It is like they came to visit and refuse to speak to her. ,False
lightGiraffe: I agree the OP was an asshole for not including her mom. ,False
fulfilledOtter: Guilty!!!,False
"openCamel: Yeah, the fact it was only for the weekend is sad. Deal with a little discomfort to impress your mother-in-law that you will deal with forever, lol.",False
eagerMonkey: With all this technology they might have had help with a translating app you know how sometimes they translate weird phrases that could have been an ice breaker,False
lightGiraffe: Right that poor mom. ,False
novelDolphin: It was plain disrespectful to me,False
"livelyBison: I agree, even though OP spoke both fluently, some Google Translate could've led to some funny shenanigans and food for conversation.",False
lightGiraffe: Same,False
lightMonkey: I don't think the woman is the asshole. It sounds like there may be some cultural clash though. As long as the husband has a fair amount of free time and the wife is still helping with the calls every once in a while I don't see the issue.,False
brightHippo: I think it would be frustrating as the husband to be translating a lot of material for the wife's family though. If they're calling every day I can see why he would want the wife to handle the calls and translating.,False
"novelCamel: Currently I'm working full-time while also going back to school for my Master's. So when my mom calls for translation-related stuff, I pass it onto my husband, since he also speaks Spanish and currently has more free time. ",False
"lightMonkey: It's kind of messed up the way he framed his view saying that they should ""just learn english"" though.",False
inquisitiveBison: I don't think the woman is an asshole. I think there may be marital issues. He's not working - so maybe ego or resentment .,False
excitedBear: My intal thought was the woman was just overwhelmed and needed her husband to help her parents. Although after hearing how her husbands opinion.  I think that the wife should take some of the responsibility since it is her parents. ,False
lightMonkey: It might be annoying but if you marry someone it shouldn't be too big of a deal. ,False
"openDolphin: I feel that the woman was just doing what any caring child would do for a parent. If anything, the husband was being an asshole for being so inconsiderate. I understand that its not always pleasant having to translate for others.",False
excitedBear: I think that they should both bear the burden of this ,False
"eagerGiraffe: It's clear that the lady may have made mistakes, relevant or irrelevant to what's written in the post. But having the text as our only piece of evidence to judge, we can judge the husband to be a little too harsh in giving such a reaction.",False
"brightHippo: I don't know. I don't like the way he worded it, but it's her family not his. If it was both of them translating equally that's on e thing, but always the husband is frustrating",False
"openDolphin: Yea, I got no indication of her being the asshole in this scenario.",False
lightMonkey: I think the wife has taken care of her parents a lot up to this moment and really needs the support while she's dealing with all the other stuff on her plate.,False
"lightMonkey: As long as she would do the same, which is sounds like she would since she's family-centered, it should be fine.",False
delightedHorse: I think they both should have same responsibility ,False
inquisitiveBison: I don't see the problem as translating but marital and something they need to discuss and work out between them Obviously he's having a problem but I don't know what,False
eagerGiraffe: It may be the lady feeling degraded out of his own childhood experiences. ,False
"eagerGiraffe: I think rather than one of these spouses being an asshole, the problem has two sides to it. ",False
brightBison: I think when he spoke to his mother in law he was polite.,False
inquisitiveBear: I didn't feel like this person was being an asshole. The mom been in the USA for over 8 years. Learning english would help her a lot. I would be frustrated just like the man.,False
excitedGiraffe: At first I thought he is the real asshole for coming off so rude to the mother in law by calling what she had been doing shit.,False
"openGorilla: Honestly it's a little hard for me to decide because he has a point, but if it't only sometimes and she's old I don't think he should necessarily expect her to learn English.",False
fulfilledDolphin: I think it's reasonable that he is frustrated with his mother in law. She's calling him a lot for fairly simple questions. ,False
brightBison: I think he got tired to being interrupted constantly.,False
brightBison: I see his point of view.,False
inquisitiveBear: She would be wise to learn english for herself. ,False
"excitedGiraffe: Then with the help of the ""edit"", I realized that he spoke to the mother kindly. ",False
openGorilla: Especially since it's easier for younger people to learn new languages idk.,False
brightBison: I don't think his family is being fair to him.,False
"excitedGiraffe: Being used like google translate for 8 years must have been very annoying for him. What is worse is that, after a while the family started to believe it is his duty. ",False
novelMonkey: I think he could be more respectful of his mother-in-law,False
fulfilledDolphin: I can understand why she would feel upset but I don't think what she is doing is reasonable or sustainable. Being independent is important.,False
"openGorilla: It sounds like the family is really resistant to seeing that learning even basic english would be better for everyone, which is a problem, though.",False
excitedGiraffe: I wish he had talked about the problem earlier... Not after dealing it with for 8 years.. ,False
brightBison: She needs to learn some english and it is not racist to say so.,False
"excitedGiraffe: Nevertheless, he is not the asshole. ",False
novelMonkey: I think depending on how he truly came across depends on if he was really being an asshole   ,False
"openGorilla: I don't know if he's been dealing with her for 8 years, it just said she's been there for 8.",False
brightBison: I agree he is not an asshole.,False
inquisitiveBear: The mother is the asshole for refusing to not learn english after living in the US for over 8 years now.,False
openGorilla: Wow.,False
novelMonkey: I think hes just frustrated ,False
"excitedGiraffe: Yes, he did not ask her to learn English for his own sake, because it is the ""American"" language, but rather because she lives in a country where English is the most spoken language. ",False
brightBison: It must get annoying after 8 years.,False
excitedGiraffe: It's too unfair to ask him to be full-time on-call translator. ,False

"curiousBison: Yes,I also agree",False
"inquisitiveElephant: Also, stating that he learned spanish in a year is kinda bogus because he stated he lives in an area where that is what is spoken, so he had some background understanding already. Also, it's been scientifically proven that the older you are",False
"inquisitiveElephant: the harder it is to learn new languages. Language barriers can be hard, but he was very much a dick to just say that to his mother in law out of nowhere.",False
livelyCamel: because she would know best how to talk to her family  ,False
delightedMonkey: My wife's mom sometimes calls me when she can't get ahold of other family members asking me to translate when she's doing basic errands or has some sort of issue with someone who can't speak spanish,False
lightHippo: Basically he is just the asshole,False
inspiredHorse: correct^,False

inquisitiveBison: Mother felt left out of conversation. Son's husband could speak English so he should speak it if needed.  I compare it to whispering.,False
openOtter: My initial impression is that the woman didn't feel included and couldn't speak to her son's partner because she doesn't know French.  Her son's partner knows English and should be polite and inlcude her in conversation. ,False

livelyElephant: I think she was calm and right to speak up and tell them how she is feeling,False
novelGorilla: She seemed to insinuate that the husband didn't speak English quite as well as her son spoke French.,False
brightHippo: I felt that she had the right to feel awkward and them making a big deal about it was rude.,False
inquisitiveBison: If they were already talking when she walked in it would be different.  But she shouldn't be excluded.,False
"openOtter: I don't think the son and his partner were trying to be rude, they are probably just very used to speaking in French now. ",False
"fulfilledZebra: If they need to discuss something in private or so no one knows/hears, then maybe they should not be doing that in the living room.",False
"openOtter: However, since everyone can speak English, and not French, I think they should use English in conversations when they're all in the living room together. That's just polite. ",False

"novelGorilla: I think perhaps, ""What are we chatting about?"" might have been a better approach than to assume offense.",False
"openOtter: I do consider both sides, I don't think anyone was purposely trying to be rude. It could be a comfort thing. ",False
"openOtter: I think the mom was right to speak up, but it's a shame her son's partner felt offended and went upstairs. ",False

"excitedBison: Uncomfortable or not, if the husband is having trouble finding the words, he could translate and include the mother in the conversation.",False

excitedHippo: maybe it would help if he goes with her to learn ,False
"openHorse: You can't tell how people are based on how they type on the internet, because the internet is a tool for venting and people tend to open up and release, that doesn't mean they speak like that.",False
"brightBear: I take it he’s not the only family member helping, he’s not been singled out for the job ",False

delightedZebra: I agree with this statement.,False
"brightCamel: It wasn't just one conversation, he barley spoke at all English. She said he knows english.",False
openBear: I agree with that sentiment as well.,False
openBear: She didn't need to cut them off and call them disrespectful. ,False
eagerDolphin: I agree that she could've addressed it better. ,False
"brightCamel: She could have, but does that make her the jerk?",False
"livelyGiraffe: If he feels more comfortable expressing some things in French, her son could still translate and include her.",False
inspiredMonkey: she came  off as one even though that wasn't her intention ,False
"brightCamel: Yes, I agree.",False
openBear: So she was an unintentional asshole. ,False
"delightedZebra: I agree that she may have not come off well to her son and his husband, however she's not an asshole.",False
eagerDolphin: Maybe the son could've been a better mediator between the two ,False

"delightedZebra: I agree, the son is the common interest, he should have intervened.",False
"brightCamel: She did say she told them ""nicely""",False
fulfilledGorilla: I think she was the asshole.,False
brightCamel: I will agree with everyone else. I guess she was an asshole. ,False
openBear: So the verdict is: unintentional asshole?,False

"livelyGiraffe: I think she is not the asshole, but could have approached it better.",False
inspiredMonkey: She was not an asshole in myopinion,False
brightCamel: True delightedZebra,False
"brightCamel: I'm saying no, she is not.",False
eagerDolphin: It was all unintentional. But I don't believe she was a true asshole.,False
fulfilledDolphin: I think the mom should be more understanding of how they live. ,False
lightBison: I do not believe this person is an asshole. It is a difficult situation and they are trying to do the best that they can. There is no right thing to do for him ,False
"curiousHorse: I think that the poster is an unintentional asshole.  I understand her reasoning, however it's rude to speak a language her mom doesn't understand and exclude her.",False
fulfilledDolphin: I do not think he is a jerk. ,False
livelyGorilla: I think that he is the asshole because he's in his mothers home. He should include her and lets not forget she doesn't see her son all the time,False
"openElephant: They switched it on us.  I think if the son would be open with the mom, they wouldnt be having this conflict.",False
"inquisitiveBear: I don't think he's being an asshole. His husband doesn't speak that much english, so he should be able to speak German when he is with his husband. I do see the mothers point, but she should be more understanding of the situation.",False
"novelCamel: I believe that the son was being the asshole because he could've just communicated with the mother ""My husband does not feel comfortable speaking English. We can talk, but I will mostly speak German while we are here.""",False
livelyGorilla: novelCamel I agree,False
"excitedGiraffe: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.",False
"curiousHorse: I think that the poster and his partner need to make more of an effort, particularly given his mom's generosity.",False
"excitedGiraffe: When you visit your mom, you speak her language.",False
curiousHorse: I agree with novelCamel,False
novelCamel: I agree that the mom is very generous. I just think the son should've communicated with both parties better. ,False
"curiousHorse: I agree, the fault lies with the son.",False
fulfilledDolphin: I think the mom should understand that his husband doesn't feel comfortable and should ask nicely to be included with her sons life more. ,False
livelyGorilla: I think they can all sit down and talk about this like adults.  Maybe the husband can make more of an effort and they can also teach the mother some german  ,False
excitedGiraffe: I'm assuming she speaks no german but he can understand English. If there's to be any meaningful discourse it would have to be in English.,False
"inquisitiveBear: It would also be very stressful on the son to have to translate between his mother and his husband. I think he should be able to have private conversations with his husband, even if they're in the mother's house.",False
excitedGiraffe: You could offer to translate for your husband while at your mom's.,False
"curiousHorse: They can have private conversations, however should excuse themselves to do so.",False
openElephant: Communication between the mother and son was the most important thing here.  She would have been much more understanding if he had told her.  The son should still try to include his mother as much as possible.,False
"fulfilledDolphin: I think the son should just talk to his mom and while him and his husband are having a conversation, they should speak however they are comfortable.",False
"curiousHorse: I understand the poster's point of view, however still feel he is in the wrong.",False
"fulfilledDolphin: yes, they should teach the mom some german.",False
lightBison: I would assume he told his mother the situation. ,False
lightBison: Its not like she is unaware of why he is speaking the way he is ,False
fulfilledDolphin: But the mom should understand that they do not normally speak english.,False
fulfilledDolphin: I feel he is NOT an asshole. ,False
inquisitiveBear: You have to also consider the husbands point of view. He should't have to feel uncomfortable in his mother-in-law's house.,False
"curiousHorse: fulfilledDolphin that's a good idea, they could teach her and make more of an effort to be inclusive.  That being said, I still think he's the (unintentional) asshole.",False
livelyGorilla: At the end of the day it is her house and she is hosting them.,False
lightBison: That is a good point livelyGorilla,False
fulfilledDolphin: My husband talks to his mom alone all the time. I don't see why he can't talk to his mom in english and his husband mostly in german,False
inquisitiveBear: I don't feel like the son's the asshole. He should be able to have private conversations with his husband wherever they may be.,False
lightBison: I am empathetic to his situation but I suppose he is an unintentional asshole.,False
"curiousHorse: He can talk to his husband in German, however why not do this in private?  Make an effort around the mom, don't make her uncomfortable.",False
fulfilledDolphin: I'm surprised everyone thinks he is in the wrong.,False
novelCamel: I think the son is just an unintentional asshole due to lack of communication. But you can't please everyone.,False
inspiredZebra: The poster is an asshole.,False
"fulfilledOtter: I agree, this poster is the asshole",False
lightCamel: I initially thought that too,False
delightedGiraffe: I think the person is an asshole.,False
inspiredZebra: Even if he learned languages quickly that doesn't mean she can learn one quickly.,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: Considering the way he worded the scenario, it's hard to believe he was respectful to his MIL, so I think he's an asshole too.",False
curiousHippo: I suspect that anyone who describes the situation with profanity is not actually as respectful as he claims,False
delightedGiraffe: He needs to be more understanding of the mother in law's situation.,False
"inspiredZebra: I agree, I think he spoke in a disrespectful manner. ",False
lightCamel: I do sympathize with him to a certain extent though-- it might be a bit frustrating to have to constantly field calls to be a translator,False
"lightCamel: Although, I think the way he went about talking to her about it was uncalled for",False
"inspiredZebra: It is frustrating, but he could have approached this better.",False
fulfilledOtter: But how did she do it prior to him? Did he make her think he didn't mind translating?,False
curiousHippo: I agree. Some people have a much more difficult time learning a language than others,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: Yes, I sympathize as well, but he's got to understand not everyone can pick up a language easily, especially when  you're older.",False
"delightedGiraffe: I understand his frustration, but he could always tell her he can't help her at the moment when she asks for his help.",False
"inspiredZebra:  Like, I might not always be easy to get a hold of, so we should help you with useful phrases.",False
"inspiredZebra: Or ask for help in spanish, which would help her english.",False
inquisitiveMonkey: Maybe he needs to help her find another translator instead of asking her to learn the language.  Google translate!,False
lightCamel: He did offer to give her help though,False
curiousHippo: I think that there could have been a much more gentle way he could have encouraged his MIL to try to learn English...MIL probablable feels humiliated she has to ask for help.,False
inspiredZebra: fulfilledOtter she may have relied on her daughter.,False
inspiredZebra: Or only stayed in her own community where others speak spanish.,False
delightedGiraffe: I think that he agreed to more than he was willing to commit to.,False
inspiredZebra: It is easy to speak your native language in areas where there are a lot of other native speakers.,False
"fulfilledOtter: Yes, but if she has been here that long it's her right to not what to learn in my opinion. If he doesn't want to translate he should just tell her that. ",False
curiousHippo: I can understand his frustration in that he doesn't think that his MIL is trying to learn the language,False
inspiredZebra: Do we all agree he is the asshole?,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: Yep, asshole.",False
lightCamel: Yes,False
fulfilledOtter: I agree he is in the wrong,False
"delightedGiraffe: I find it interesting that after 8 years, she hasn't learned any English, though. (To play devil's advocate)",False
curiousHippo: I think he should apologize to keep the peace,False
inspiredZebra: I have russian family members that never learned english.,False
inspiredZebra: They never left their small neighborhood.,False
lightCamel: Remember though-- we're only getting his side of the story. It's possible that she does know a bit but he's exaggerating to make his point,False
curiousHippo: Some people have a much harder time learning than others.,False
"fulfilledOtter: Yes, she could live in a neighborhood that is primarily speaking spanish as well. ",False
"inquisitiveMonkey: Yeah, she may understand some english but gets overwhelmed with certain types of conversations, like doctors",False
"curiousHippo: Yes, it sounds like she doesn't always need a translator?",False
"fulfilledBear: This is a tough one, I can see both sides.",False
curiousDolphin: Me too,False
"delightedMonkey: I think both sides are being assholes, wife and husband.",False
fulfilledBear: I agree delightedMonkey,False
inquisitiveHorse: Agreed. I think both but I think that you can't expect the husband to do it. Wife should respect his wishes,False
"brightHippo: I think she is an asshole. She shouldn't be forcing her husband to take on the role of translator. Even though her married her, he didn't sign up for a job as a translator.",False
curiousDolphin: I'm sort of wondering why the person who was posting wasn't as willing to take their mom's calls?,False
"delightedMonkey: She's busy with a master's degree, she says he has more free time.",False
"brightHippo: Her reasoning was because she was too busy, I think",False
"curiousDolphin: I know they said they were working full time, but it shows a lack of respect for her husband ",False
fulfilledBear: Yes curiousDolphin The poster said she was getting a Masters but it reads like she finished yet still expected her husband to do all the work.,False
brightHippo: It's like she thinks his free time isn't valuable because he isn't in school,False
inquisitiveHorse: Yeah it shouldn't be expected ,False
fulfilledBear: And she is assuming he is free when he gets the calls always.,False
"delightedMonkey: These are her parents, she's done this for them all her life so it's hard for her to understand why he can't do it too.",False
fulfilledBear: I know I can't get calls at work.,False
fulfilledBear: True de,False
"inquisitiveHorse: Also, seems like she makes fun of him being a gringo but wants to use him for his spanish too",False
fulfilledBear: yup.,False
"delightedMonkey: It would be nice if he would do it, but should not be expected.",False
fulfilledBear: I also wonder how appreciative she is about it. Does she acknowledge that he always steps up?,False
fulfilledBear: People grow resentful when it is apparent the effort isn't appreciated.,False
"delightedMonkey: Exactly, I agree fulfilledBear",False
"brightHippo: It seems like she doesn't appreciate it because she expects it. and now that he is standing up and saying no, she is pissed she isn't getting her way like she always has",False
fulfilledBear: I agree brightHippo,False
curiousDolphin: Me too,False
"curiousDolphin: I think this person was the asshole, but so was the mother",False
"livelyBison:  I understand that always being relied on to act as translator is exhausting and frustrating, but he didn't need to be mean about it. ",False
"livelyBison: . He is being cruel by flippantly suggesting that she just ""learn english""; there may be a lot of outside circumstances that make it a lot harder for his mother in law to access English learning",False
"livelyBison: She might not have the time, or the money, or honestly the confidence. He is being an asshole here by basically saying the mother is dumb because she can't just pick up a foreign language. ",False
"inquisitiveHorse: I believe he was being polite to his mother in law but abrasive in his post. Still, that is family, and he should be there for her. While it might have been easy for him to learn multiple languages in a short period of time,",False
inquisitiveHorse: it is obviously not as easy for her. He needs to learn compassion.,False
livelyBison: Even if he says he was polite when he spoke to her I'm sure his tone came through. You can tell by the language he uses he doesn't respect her. ,False
openMonkey: I can't imagine that it happens all that often anough for him to be so angry.,False
excitedOtter: In my opinion I dont think the author is the asshole. If you live in japan you should learn Japanese. Its been 8 years as the author stated. That is ample time to learn it offhand just by having conversations. ,False
livelyBison: I agree he needs some compassion!,False
"brightCamel: Even though I could imaging that it is hard to always be a translator, it is also insensitive to put someone down for not wanting to learn another language. Learning languages is hard, and its not right to pressure someone to do so.",False
curiousBear: It's a lot more difficult for older people to learn a foreign language. He should recognize that his ability to pick up Spanish is indeed a privilege and shouldn't expect that of other people.,False
excitedOtter: Japan is an example I know they live in California,False
inquisitiveHorse: marriage is about compromise. He should just do it for his wife if for no other reason.,False
openMonkey: I do think she should learn Engligh enough to be able to have a life though,False
"livelyBison: I'm not trying to be combative, but have you ever lived in a foreign country?",False
excitedOtter: If I lived anywhere for 8 years it's customary to speak their predominant language ,False
fulfilledDolphin: He just seems like an asshole. He could have totally approached the matter in a different. It's great he was able to pick up on different languages. Maybe he could reach out and tech them.,False
"livelyBison: It's really disorienting, stressful, and anxiety inducing. Most of the time, you don't just ""pick up"" a language",False
"brightCamel: i agree, marriage is about compromise. Learning a new language is no easy feat",False
"openMonkey: after 8 years, she should be able to at least have a limited conversation or take someone with her to translate",False
curiousBear: She lives in an area with mostly Spanish-speaking people so it seems like she might've been able to get around just fine without English.,False
openMonkey: that's true curiousBear,False
"inquisitiveHorse: It does not sound like she is out in the world a lot, otherwise she would be able to do more. If everyone around her speaks her own language, then it would be hard to learn English.",False
"excitedOtter: Learning a new language is very difficult I know. It's been almost a decade, anyone with 8 years worth of time in a different country should be able to order food at the very least",False
"curiousBear: There's just going to be situations with more difficult vocabulary that she requires a translator. Even if she ""learned English"", with the rate of a second language acquisition, it'd be very difficult for her to prepare for these rare cases",False
"livelyBison: I have to say, I really disagree. I think it's easy to learn stuff like ""please"" and ""thanks"", but having a discussion is an entirely different matter.",False
fulfilledDolphin: Also consider the fact English is the most difficult language to learn.,False
"livelyBison: Yeah English makes no sense, gramatically. ",False
"inquisitiveHorse: I feel he is in the wrong here. It does not sound like he is translating for her every day. And since he is obviously intelligent enough to know multiple languages, then maybe he should be the one teaching her. ",False
excitedOtter: If it's occasionally she needs a translator then he is the asshole. But as he was stating it it's for essentially everything. What if the husband is busy? He has a life too and I think it's selfish if shes calling him every day to translate,False
livelyBison: grammatically*,False
livelyBison: Somehow I get the feeling he is exaggerating ,False
"curiousBear: I do understand why he might be frustrated. Even though he isn't the only one that she goes to for translation, he might feel that because he is not blood family that does have the same obligation.",False
"inquisitiveHorse: the post said ""sometimes calls me""",False
openMonkey: it sounded like it was only when no one else was available that it happened,False
"livelyBison: I just can't imagine that this woman is calling him multiple times per day, per week. I too understand the frustration, but he is being a jerk.",False
excitedOtter: If he is exaggerating then I agree he is the asshole,False
fulfilledDolphin: Yep he's the asshole. Even reading his statement he sounds like an angry person.,False
"openMonkey: yes, i think he's an asshole",False
livelyBison: Yeah def the asshole,False
brightCamel: He is an asshole for trying to impose his views on her.,False
inquisitiveHorse: Everyone needs to vote.,False
"livelyBison: Simple as that, for sure! ",False
eagerGiraffe: Ok so in the situation I would say the author is the asshole by how they are handling it and not the action itself to make the husband translate.,False
novelZebra: i think that having to translate once in a while shouldn't be that big of a deal,False
fulfilledGorilla: I think the author is an asshole for always nagging her husband to translate things and making him drop everything he is doing to do so. It is selfish and annoying.,False
inspiredOtter: The husband has more free time. The husband is part of the family. The husband needs to be supportive of his wife and her family since it is not a huge time requirement. ,False
novelZebra: exactly,False
"excitedCamel: If the man married the woman, then he agreed to support her. This is simply one of the areas that the wife feels that she needs support. It is his responsibility to help.",False
"excitedCamel: Although I don't understand one part. If the wife is saying that it's not that big of a time commitment, then why can't she do it?",False
"excitedCamel: I understand that she's more busy than the husband, but if it's only 10 minutes then why can't she do it?",False
eagerGiraffe: Saying using rosetta stone or duolingo is a privilege is wrong because duolingo is free. Also I think it's hypocritical of the author to say he should step up to the plate for 10 minutes why cant she? Everybody has 10 minutes in a day,False
novelZebra: the husband should be more willing to help her parents....it doesn't sem like it happens very often,False
"inspiredOtter: The wife works plus is going to school. The husband has more free time. He should be more than willing to help out. If this was a daily thing, or something that took hours, I could understand his frustration.",False
eagerGiraffe: in,False
novelZebra: i agree too,False
fulfilledGorilla: I understand that as well,False
eagerGiraffe: inspiredOtter I agree with you. We are given a lack of information. I say if it truly is a few minutes once in a while its not big deal. If they are underplaying it and its hours a week then the author is the asshole,False
brightBear: I agree,False
"inspiredOtter: Agree, eagerGiraffe",False
inspiredOtter: there is not enough information. ,False
"inspiredOtter: but with what is presented, he should step up. They are married, and it is called compromise. ",False
novelZebra: exactly,False
excitedCamel: I agree,False
eagerGiraffe: Agree all of marriage is a compromise essentially,False
inspiredOtter: Wish we could assign partial idiocy :) ,False
eagerGiraffe: In reddit there is ESH (everybody sucks here) as well as NHA (no asshole here) ,False
brightBear: So do we agree the wife is not the asshole?,False
eagerGiraffe: but with either asshole or not asshole we have to assign it and id say not the asshole,False
eagerGiraffe: yes brightBear,False
novelZebra: yes,False
inspiredOtter: i agree. she is not.,False
excitedCamel: She is not,False
inspiredOtter: Still a lot of votes out.,False
eagerGiraffe: Everyone needs to vote for the study fellow animals ,False
livelyHorse: She could have said it differently,False
lightGiraffe: Yes she could have approached it a different way.,False
curiousHippo: I think she has a right to be shown respect because it's her house.,False
lightGiraffe: Instead of stopping them in the middle of the conversation why could she just not talk to the son in private,False
inspiredGorilla: It is embarrassing to be in a room and not speak language,False
"delightedBear: She may be assuming his English is better than it actually is, but my initial impression is, they should not be having full conversations in front of her.  That leaves her out and is rude.",False
inquisitiveDolphin: My initial impression was the the author was the asshole. This was because she could've said it differently. Or she could've asked if the partner was uncomfortable or shy about speaking english in front of them,False
livelyHorse: I dont think they were disrespectful,False
"livelyHorse: she couldve asked them to teach her, or she couldve make a lighthearted joke",False
inspiredGorilla: I don't think they meant to be disrespectful but was embarrassing.,False
lightGiraffe: Is it polite to sit there and have a conversation like that when someone else is around? probably not. But it's more rude to interrupt and try to call them out like that,False
livelyHorse: yeah I think maybe the husband was slightly embarassed,False
"openElephant: The son and partner are staying at her house for a week. They could have been more considerate about language, particularly since the partner speaks English without much problem.",False
curiousHippo: I agree that she should have had a private conversation with the son instead of stopping the conversation and pointing it out in the open.,False
livelyHorse: yeah,False
delightedBear: I see wrong on both ends,False
"inspiredGorilla: Yes, that is true she could have waited until later to mention it to son.",False
inquisitiveDolphin: I think it would be okay to address it with the partner. But it seems like it could've been done in a less tense way maybe.,False
inspiredGorilla: I think the son's partner was overreacting,False
curiousHippo: I can also understand her point especially because the partner speaks English.,False
"delightedBear: Her son told her she was making everyone feel awkward, whereas they were making her feel awkward.",False
livelyHorse: Thats like saying if you're not gonna speak the Queen's English dont talk at all...,False
lightGiraffe: The partner is probably embarassed as well about not being able to speak English well- it could be definitely a good opportunity for the two of them to bond a bit. ,False
livelyHorse: I think the son didnt know how to react because he was embarsased instead of apologizing. ,False
lightGiraffe: The whole thing is mad awkward lol,False
livelyHorse: yeahhhh,False
inspiredGorilla: The son should consider how it would make mom feel like a third wheel too.,False
"inquisitiveDolphin: Yeah, I could see that the author felt excluded. Both sides could've addressed it better, I think",False
"delightedBear: Again though, she says the husband speaks English, so either he doesn't speak English as well as she thinks, or he doesn't care to speak english.  I feel as if it's the latter, and that's rude.",False
delightedBear: Given the circumstance and situation.  Knowing she doesn't speak French.,False
"inspiredGorilla: Both overreacted, each side.",False
curiousHippo: At first I would've said she wasn't at fault because it's her house and it is kind of rude to be speaking a different language and exclude her but this should have been handled in private and she wasn't being fair either.,False
openElephant: The son could have done better in easing the situation...,False
inspiredGorilla: I agree with that,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I agree with curiousHippo,False
delightedBear: I am leaning towards her not being the asshole.  Because the situation was started by the son and his husband.  They should have known better.,False
delightedBear: If they wouldn't have had a conversation in front of her in another language this wouldn't have happened.  Regardless of them all being wrong afterwards.,False
inspiredGorilla: Son is at fault.,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I feel like there was assholery on both sides,False
lightGiraffe: It's his partner's primary language,False
lightGiraffe: They were both buttholes but she was more rude,False
curiousHippo: I said yes that she was but it's very marginal. I could see people saying the opposite. ,False
openElephant: I think as a visitor the partner could have tried to speak English more even if he was embarrassed,False
lightGiraffe: Love you guys though,False
"curiousCamel: Taking into consideration everything in the article, she could have told her mom in advance why she'd be speaking in German, and how her husband felt. Maybe then her mom would understand.  And if not she could always translate for her mom.",False
inquisitiveElephant: This was really tricky for me because I could see both sides. I felt like they all just needed to sit down before the visit and have a long talk and each side compromise a little.,False
"livelyHippo: I think she has good ntentions, but her impact is bad. Shes  TA not bc she speaks German too, but because she intentionall excludeds her mom she could speak both when at her moms.",False
"fulfilledGorilla: My opinion is that if the mother is hosting them and providing meals, they should have made the conscious effort to include the mother more in the conversation. ",False
livelyHippo: A way to collaborate instead of compromise,False
delightedGiraffe: I think this person is an asshole because the mother is letting them stay at her house and is feeding them too and I don't understand why he has to choose between making his mother or husband comfortable.,False
"curiousCamel: That is true, and it'd be a great opportunity for him to further refine learning English",False
"livelyHippo: I see no reason why not to speak both, why does it have to be one or the other",False
livelyHippo: I agree with cur,False
"curiousCamel: Which if they live part time in the US and part time in Germany, he'll have to learn anyway",False
lightZebra: I think that the son should have explained first to the mom the situation.  The son could spend some time with the mom interpretating and some time in private.,False
livelyHippo: curiousCamel,False
inquisitiveElephant: That's a good point that it could've helped him refine his english more,False
delightedGiraffe: The husband understands English and obviously speaks it but I can see why he would feel more comfortable speaking German.,False
openBear: I think she is an asshole in that she doesn't think she could have done anything more to help both her husband and her mom...,False
lightZebra: The partner should be willing to speak some English since he is staying at her house.,False
"fulfilledGorilla: I think she ""is the asshole"" - she could have figured out a way to find a common ground between the mom and the partner. ",False
inquisitiveElephant: It didn't sound like the son or daughter explained the situation to the mom. and I thought they were the asshole for not having that discussion to try to find common ground,False
delightedGiraffe: The mom is doing everything to make them feel at home so him excluding her isn't right.,False
"curiousCamel: The article really makes it seem as if she is unwilling to compromise to please her husband, while putting out her own mother who is hosting them. I believe she is TA.",False
fulfilledGorilla: Exactly,False
inquisitiveElephant: I'd agree,False
fulfilledGorilla: man you guys are good,False
lightZebra: The son seems immature saying partner comes first.  Shouldn't visit mom if he was going to be rude.,False
openBear: she could always speak german with her husband in private...,False
"fulfilledGorilla: Yeah even if you aren't comfortable with it, just give it an hour and try- just to make the mom feel better at the very least",False
delightedGiraffe: I think it's very immature and there's no reason why there couldn't be some sort of compromises made. Neither the partner or the mom had to be excluded. They both could've learned from each other too.,False
"lightZebra: Yes, the son and his partner need to give a little bit",False
fulfilledGorilla: You're very smart animals,False
lightZebra: Thank you fulfilledGorilla you too,False
"inquisitiveElephant: My vote would be the person is ""the asshole"" because I think the son and his partner should've talked this over with the mom instead of just excluding her.",False
curiousCamel: seems like everyone is in agreeance,False
delightedGiraffe: I voted that they are the asshole because of their unwillingness to compromise.,False
fulfilledGorilla: I also voted asshole,False
fulfilledGorilla: A conscious effort was made to exclude the mother,False
fulfilledGorilla: They chose to,False
brightGorilla: hi,False
fulfilledOtter: hi,False
excitedHorse: Hi,False
eagerBison: hi,False

"inquisitiveBear: Definitely not an asshole, just caught between a rock and a hard place.",False
brightGorilla: how do yopu think guys,False
"fulfilledOtter: Same, definitely not an asshole.",False
brightGorilla:  that girl is  asshole?,False
novelGiraffe: So this guy finally gets a chance to see his family and decides to not speak a language his mom can understand.  ,False
brightGorilla: i think she is asshole,False
excitedHorse: I think she is an asshole.,False
eagerBison: She is not an asshole,False
lightDolphin: i think she is an asshole as well,False
"delightedElephant: I personally think this person is being the asshole.. I mean the husband can speak English, and instead of including everyone she is excluding her mom.",False
novelGiraffe: I think he's an asshole,False
brightGorilla: she must include her mom during conversation.,False
delightedElephant: Especially when she is staying in her home.,False
excitedHorse: They are guests at the mom's house and acting entitles.,False
"lightDolphin: i can understand her not wanting to make her husband uncomfortable, but it is rude to exclude her mother",False
inquisitiveBear: He was either going to make his mom feel uncomfortable or his husband feel uncomfortable.,False
brightGorilla: I  imagine her mom sitting during lunch and be an aline,False
brightGorilla: alien,False
excitedHorse: There seems to be a ready compromise she is not taking.,False
"novelGiraffe: Definately rude and uncalled for.  Should have agreed ahead of time that if the guy who doesn't speak english talks, he would translate it",False
brightGorilla: ya you are right,False
"lightDolphin: he can speak english, so he would be able to understand, there are ways to be consideerate without excluding anyone",False
fulfilledOtter: the thing is he can always use both languages and translates conversation for both people,False
inquisitiveBear: He could have helped his mom by showing her how to use a translator on the phone and making it fun for her. ,False
fulfilledOtter: and explain to his mother after talking in german,False
novelGiraffe: I like that google translate idea,False
"eagerBison: When she got married, she left her mother and became one with him and he comes first. She can talk to her mom when they are alone having girl time.",False
delightedElephant: She could talk with her mother and explain that his English isn't the best and to be understanding. I get being embarrassed but they are in an English speaking house.,False
brightGorilla: so what is  final decision,False
novelGiraffe: Asshole,False
brightGorilla: is she  an asshole?,False
lightDolphin: asshole,False
delightedElephant: Asshole,False
excitedHorse: The partner can take it as an opportunity to feel more comfortable in his English by taking risks in what could be a more supportive environment.,False
delightedElephant: Exactly! I agree,False
"inquisitiveBear: Tell the mom husband feels uncomfortable speaking English, as a mom she should understand.",False
eagerBison: It maybe a good thing to speak german because mom maybe trying to be all in their relationship.,False
brightGorilla: its a point too,False
"delightedElephant: The best way to learn is to practice conversation, would be a good time to brush up on his English in a non-judgemental environment",False
brightGorilla:  may be she is too lazy to translate all the time to her mom.,False
novelGiraffe: The husband can man up too and try to speak english,False
excitedHorse: Which is why all of them speaking the same language would be beneficial.,False
"fulfilledOtter: Well he did say it's his own choice, not because of laziness",False
"fulfilledOtter: Thing is, his husband can speak bad English but his mother cannot speak German at all",False
"delightedElephant: German is fine for personal conversations between the two but all the time is just excessive. She's a mom excited that her daughter is home, she wants to talk to her.",False
"brightGorilla: whatever, she acts selfish",False
"inquisitiveBear: I can see that point of view, too, could help husband by speaking English.",False
"excitedHorse: Even as adults, we are our parents children. She is not taking into account her mother's choices.",False
"lightDolphin: i've been in a situation like the mom has been in, except everyone was comfortable in english. It's rude, and being left out like that is hurtful",False
novelGiraffe: I think he's an asshole,False
fulfilledOtter: It's never hurt to ask for explanation unless they intentionally hide the truth from her,False
"delightedElephant: Yeah, I would understand if he could not speak any English but he can and everyone else can too",False
"brightGorilla: so final answer is she is  an ""asshole"" ",False
brightGorilla: yes?,False
delightedElephant: Yes,False
eagerBison: My final answer is no,False
fulfilledOtter: We are supposed to judge on the man aren't we ,False
fulfilledOtter: not his mother,False
"inquisitiveBear: I think he's a reluctant asshole, would have been an asshole either way, to mom or husband.",False
"inquisitiveBear: I vote yes, an asshole.",False
brightGorilla: yes,False
excitedHorse: yes,False
eagerGorilla: hi,False
excitedZebra: thoughts?,False
livelyDolphin: She's not an asshole,False
"inspiredOtter: Definitely not an asshole, just wanting to know what the convo is and wanting to participate.",False
inquisitiveElephant: I don't think shes being an asshole. She wants to talk to her son and everyone be included in conversation. The son is there to translate if needed,False
excitedZebra: i agree. not an asshole,False
excitedZebra: she wasn't rude about,False
eagerGorilla: She is not the asshole,False
livelyDolphin: it's disrespectful to speak a seperate language around someone who WANTS to be included in a conversation and means well,False
inspiredOtter: She hasn't seen her child in a while and wanted to know what was going on in his life.,False
eagerGorilla: The fact that she nicely told her child about the issue makes her not the asshole.,False
"inspiredOtter: Yeah, I agree. She was nice and really, they came all that way to see her and she literally has no idea what they are talking about. ",False
livelyDolphin: For them to storm off when someone just wants to be included shows who the real asshole is.,False
"inquisitiveElephant: Yeah, I understand the partner might not be as comfortable in English but he's in an environment where thats okay",False
inspiredOtter: He could always put some of the German language in their convo to help husband.,False
"inquisitiveElephant: Exactly, the son obviously speaks both, why can't he translate for the both of them?",False
"inspiredOtter: Yeah, I agree, storming off is not an answer but why come all that way to speak a language the person you came to see doesn't understand?",False
"inspiredOtter: Yes, he could translate, and keep her part of the conversation. ",False
"fulfilledBison: I don't know whose the asshole here, it could be the son or the partner",False
"inspiredOtter: I vote the mother is not an asshole, just wanting to catch up with her son and get to know his partner.",False
excitedZebra: they all speak english so it's not as though his partner can't he just may not be as comfortable. she should be respectful of this but its not wrong to want to be included,False
"inspiredOtter: Even if he can't speak it well, the son can help partner out.",False
eagerGorilla: Mother's not the asshole,False
"inspiredOtter: Agreed, mom's not an asshole. ",False
livelyDolphin: I think the mom is NOT an asshole,False
inspiredOtter: So we're all in agreement.,False
inquisitiveElephant: The mom is not an asshole,False
"inspiredOtter: Thanks, guys, for the helpful thoughts.",False
openCamel: I think she's an asshole for forcing her husband to do this by himself. He didn't sign up for this. She should at least help sometimes.,False
"eagerGorilla: I feel that she is partially the asshole for shoving it all onto her husband, and I do not agree that ""But he's married me, so my mom is his family too"" mentality",False
"fulfilledZebra: I don't think they are the asshole.   I think the initial request was from a good natured place, the tone has taken a turn for the worse, but that doesn't rise to the level of asshole.",False
"brightHorse: The husband should help his mother-in-law because they are all one family. The writer should not cloud the issue by suggesting that it's only 10 minutes. But, they are family.",False
excitedDolphin: I think she's an asshole for making her husband perform tasks on his own time and forcing him to put his life on hold. ,False
openCamel: I think she should at least help sometimes though.,False
curiousElephant: I feel she is partially to blame for not asking if her husband minds helping. I also didn't like the fact that her logic was that since her married he he should always have to help,False
"brightHorse: The husband has more free time, so is not putting his life on hold. Now, if he could set boundaries and schedule time specifically for these tasks as they arise.",False
eagerGorilla: If only we could say that they are both the asshole like the subreddit.,False
"excitedDolphin: I mean that's true, help out here and there, but if her husband has gotten increasingly irritated after constant translations then she's doing this more often than usual.",False
excitedDolphin: But it's more like everyone sucks here to be quite honest.,False
excitedDolphin: Maybe they need to work out a timed schedule/communication more to ensure that his life doesn't get put on hold while he's also helping her out.,False
"brightHorse: I agree with eagerGorilla They are both being unreasonable with their extreme ""my-way-only"" attitudes.",False
"fulfilledZebra: I feel like the tone is problematic at the end, but maybe this was in the heat of the moment after an argument, and the story is clouded.",False
openCamel: I agree they need to work something out so the load is not all on him.,False
"fulfilledZebra: I feel like he helps out, but got annoyed like most married people do with their in-laws, shared his opinion and she clapped back.",False
curiousElephant: It would help if she specified how much free time her husband has. It could turn out that he doesn't have as much free time as she thinks,False
"fulfilledZebra: They need to work something out, but does that make someone an asshole?",False
fulfilledZebra: If I have a disagreement with my spouse is someone always an asshole?,False
excitedDolphin: I feel like it's mostly YTA/ESH,False
brightHorse: I still don't think she's an asshole for expecting him to help his mother-in-law.,False
fulfilledZebra: I agree with bri,False
openCamel: I think this makes her sound like an asshole because it sounds like she is not considering his feelings about this at all. She thinks it's his obligation and of course he has to do this. He has no choice.,False
"brightHorse: I think that looking at the issue - should he help him mother-in-law - yes, he should. And the wife is not an asshole to ask.",False
fulfilledZebra: I have seen worse. ,False
delightedGorilla: I think this one comes down to whether you believe someone should learn the language or not.,False
eagerHorse: This is a hard spot for him to be in but it sounds like he was rude to them even though he said he was respectful in the edit.,False
livelyGiraffe: If she has to have help she needs to learn the language,False
"inspiredCamel: I think that what makes him an asshole is his attitude. He says he spoke to her with respect, but I don't think so. I seems this type of thing happens a lot. And he can't hide is frustration anymore.",False
livelyGiraffe: If we trust him that he spoke with respect hes not the asshole.,False
livelyGiraffe: but that's opinion,False
"lightBear: Everyone sucks here/Your the asshole. I understand that people need to be independent in life to get through challenges, but you’re an asshole for suggesting that she should just do it on her own and just “learn it”. ",False
lightBear: It’s not so easy for some people to learn a new language right away (especially at an older age) and sometimes impossible for some due to time constraints.,False
"lightBear: I feel like if you would offer to help her learn it with her, then that would make you less of an asshole since she trusts you enough to ask you for guidance when translating. ",False
"eagerHorse: I think she should learn the language too, but it's very difficult when you're older. I think whether he was an asshole depends how he approached her with this suggestion.",False
"novelOtter: To be fair, according to him he offered to help her in learning the language. He also said it was the whole family that needed to learn, not just her.",False
lightBear: Yeah that's my thoughts exactly. I wish he would help her personally since she trusts him enough to ask him for help.,False
"inspiredCamel: I teach ESL and think folks should make the effort. But not everyone is as good with languages as this husband. And the point is that he's letting his belief that she should learn English, cloud the fact that she's his MIA. Just help her. ",False
delightedGorilla: I don't think he is an asshole in terms of his thoughts at all.,False
lightBear: That's true,False
"livelyGiraffe: I do not completely trust him that he is explaining his issues in a calm fashion, and that he is phrasing in a respectful manner.",False
delightedGorilla: I feel like it is just about tone.,False
eagerHorse: I'm in this position of helping my parents. The problem is it's not just a few hours a week. It feels like a second job. It can take hours each time and it usually happens several times a week.,False
delightedGorilla: Is being an asshole about tone or what you truly believe?,False
lightBear: I think it's his tone that does make him sound like an asshole tbh,False
eagerHorse: I agree the tone is bad.,False
"inspiredCamel: For me, it's about the tone. I work with people I don't like all the time. But I have to keep a civil tone.",False
"livelyGiraffe: His beliefs are reasonable, they should have learned the language rather than rely on their daughter for so many years.",False
lightBear: His thoughts are understandable but the way he executed them are terrible,False
"delightedGorilla: Well it depends on how he truly conveyed the message, which isn't clear.",False
delightedGorilla: Reading between the lines suggests condescension,False
inspiredCamel: I think he should try to set some boundaries for when he can help out in this way.,False
delightedGorilla: But it is not necessarily true.,False
novelOtter: Also seems her family took things to far. Just because he said they should learn English doesn't make him a racist. Only problem is if he is being honest about how he brought it up,False
"livelyGiraffe: Im not going to read to far into it, just gonna trust him",False
eagerHorse: I think it all comes down to whether you believe his edit.,False
eagerHorse: I think he just added that because he was probably getting attacked in the comments.,False
livelyGiraffe: Yep.,False
fulfilledGorilla: My initial thought is there are a lot of cultural implications and that the writer is not an asshole.,False
excitedElephant: RIght off the bat I don't think the point that America is a country of immigrants helps OP,False
inquisitiveBison: This person doesn't have a right to demand anyone do this for her parents,False
delightedBear: I think that her husband should be willing to help her parents,True
curiousDolphin: i think the husband should quit complaining and just do it.,False
"fulfilledGorilla: I think in relationships there are give and takes and marrying into Latinx culture, the big emphasis is family is very close and supports one another, which is something the husband might not get.",False
excitedElephant: The husband learned Spanish did he not? If the parents have been here all this time (presumably) then why can't the parents learn enough english to get by.,False
curiousDolphin: her married her so its his mother too.,False
inquisitiveBison: The person also uses marriage as a reason the husband is responsible to work as a translator for her parents,False
"delightedBear: I see how it could become annoying, but it is dramatic to just say they should have learned English. Not something that can be done over night",True
inquisitiveBison: No account is given of the husband's workload whatsoever,False
"excitedElephant: True, but it can be done, and to just dismiss it isn't right.",False
fulfilledGorilla: Yeah there doesn't seem to be a lot of perspective taking from the author or the husband,False
curiousDolphin: the husband might just think that he does not have the time to do it.,False
delightedBear: They said the husband has more time on his hands than her,True
inquisitiveBison: No one has the right to dictate how another person spends their time,False
"excitedElephant: I could see having the husband translate sometimes, but just all the time seems to be taking advantage",False
delightedBear: Are they taking advantage or is he over exaggerating ,True
fulfilledGorilla: I wonder if they discussed things like this prior to getting married.  A lot of marriages fail over broken communication and expectations.,False
"curiousDolphin: he should just do it to be nice and keep the peace, for his marriage.",False
inquisitiveBison: Immature the husband would freely do it occasionally if he didnt feel obligated to do it,False
excitedElephant: Well OP did say that they just give the husband the phone because they are too busy,False
inquisitiveBison: *I'm sure,False
fulfilledGorilla: Also the fact that the mother is calling the husband as opposed to her child is a topic of interest,False
"curiousDolphin: yes, the mother might like him better.",False
"fulfilledGorilla: Almost like he feels it's been forced upon him, not something he's asked to do.",False
fulfilledGorilla: But at the same time I would love to support my mother-in-law in that situation if I could.,False
"inquisitiveBison: The person explains only her schedule as being busy but mentions nothing of the husbands, possibly an attempt to bias the observer",False
fulfilledGorilla: Everyone who posts these stories always tries to bias the reader towards their side.,False
"excitedElephant: Right that is the thing that bugs me most, sometimes helping translate is alright, but why should he do it ALL the time",False
"excitedElephant: I think OP is an asshole, albeit a slight one",False
inquisitiveBison: This person is the asshole for forcing expectations on her husband that are her own responsibility,False
lightGorilla: My impression is that he could have just declined,False
"excitedHorse: This is a tough one, I think I'd have to side with the OP though",False
"fulfilledBison: I think based on the way he presented his argument, he is an asshole.",False
lightGorilla: There was no reason for him to tell the mother what he wanted her to do,False
inquisitiveElephant: he could have night said no nicely.,False
excitedHorse: 8 years is a long time for someone to live somewhere and only pick up a few phrases,False
brightZebra: I think that he should be more considerate and help,False
excitedHorse: He clarified at the end that he was polite,False
inquisitiveElephant: he could have found a teacher for her.,False
"lightGorilla: He could have declined without telling her what she ""should"" do",False
fulfilledBison: Just because you are polite doesn't mean you can dictate what others can/should do.,False
inquisitiveElephant: 8 years is along time not to learn english.,False
lightGorilla: You can politely tell someone to not talk anymore. Doesn't mean that you're showing respect. ,False
inquisitiveElephant: he should probably just do it to keep the peace.,False
excitedHorse: 8 years is more than enough time to learn enough english to be conversational,False
"fulfilledBison: Some people have a hard time learning things as well, especially in areas where the population is still predominantly Latinx",False
"excitedHorse: I understand they come from different cultures, but come on",False
brightZebra: If they are not emerged in the culture it may be difficult,False
lightGorilla: The bottom line for me is that he made it personal and didn't have to. He could have declined.,False
inquisitiveElephant: he could learn a little more tact.,False
fulfilledBison: That's a big point lightGorilla,False
excitedHorse: If I knew that I would be spending the rest of my life in a foreing country then I would make a great effort to learn te language,False
lightGorilla: He also then compared his own accomplishments and assumed that everyone should have his aptitude,False
inquisitiveElephant: yes he made it personal and hurt her feelings.,False
excitedHorse: He did however come across like a jerk in the post,False
excitedHorse: Yeah that part was a little ridiculous,False
fulfilledBison: Just because it took him a year to learn Spanish doesn't mean it's easy for them to learn English.  He could have learned with formalized instruction.,False
excitedHorse: True,False
"fulfilledBison: I have tried using DuoLingo to learn different languages and it is not easy unless you do it constantly.  It is very repetitious, at least in the beginning.",False
excitedHorse: I'm leaning towards asshole because of his approach in handling the situation,False
"fulfilledBison: I believe based on sentiment, even though he said he was nice to her, he is an asshole.",False
lightGorilla: His own personal beliefs seems to intrude on his ability to respect another person's life decisions,False
inquisitiveElephant: i think he is the asshole.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: I think he has a right to be frustrated, but based on the rest of his post he was not as polite and respectful as he claimed.",False
"novelCamel: I agree, what does everyone else think?",False
inspiredGiraffe: The MIL should be learning English by living here.  Probably is hard but we all have to learn as we go.,False
curiousBear: I feel like this is a big difference between saying what you mean and meaning what you say. the way it was stated he sounded very direspecting of the situation but then he seemed confused why family was so upset,False
delightedBison: The writer  comes off as passive aggressive which rings an alarm. He does have a right to be annoyed I think anyone would be.,False
"livelyDolphin: yeah, I agree with the passive agressiveness",False
inspiredGiraffe: They too were disrespectful for relying on him to interpret all the time.  ,False
"curiousBear: I agree his feelings are valid, but she is also old and elderly often rely on the kids and if shed been relying on others so long perhaps a better approach would have been to work with family to help her learn",False
"inspiredGiraffe: Because she is old and elderly does not give her the right to ""expect"" him to always be the interpreter.",False
"curiousBear: but if shed been helped without resistance for years, him ""popping off"" as the kids say is uncalled for",False
"inquisitiveOtter: If the other children were able to interpret, they should have. I do think he has a right to be frustrated, but I get the impression he took it out on the MIL and handled it poorly. His beef should have been with her other children.",False
curiousBear: he held no tact in the situation,False
inspiredGiraffe: The family has valid reasons to be upset but still I do not believe they are in the right to expect him to not be upset. He could have used a different way to express.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Assuming that she should be able to do it because he was able to do it makes me feel like he lacks empathy and understanding in the situation, as well.",False
delightedBison: No it doesn't give her the right. But it doesn't give him a right to be rude either. If he can't handle it he should talk it out with his wife to make arrangements where she doesn't call him as much.,False
livelyDolphin: I think that overall the author could definitely be more tactful. You don't get constructive conversation and change from 'popping off' as one of the previous posters put it,False
delightedBison: I agree the Auther could be more tactful.,False
"curiousBear: In my perspective, all feelings are totally valid in the situation, but the follow through was absolutely wrong in its approach",False
livelyDolphin: I'd say that the author is 'an asshole' due to his handling of the situation. ,False
curiousBear: agree ,False
delightedBison: agree,False
inspiredGiraffe: He was not tactful in how he choose to deal with the situation but he has very valid reasons and I believe his reasons are accurate.,False
excitedBison: Im a little in between on this one but ultimate;y think she was a bit dramatic,False
"fulfilledHorse: So, I'm thinking that she is the asshole here too. Seems to me like she isn't taking her husbands concerns seriously and is avoiding the work to help her family",False
curiousGorilla: My thought is she should have equally been taking the calls instead of passing them on and choosing that she is more busy than he is,False
excitedBison: granted the husbands initial action may have ticked her off too,False
inspiredElephant: Seeing the other side of this situation makes it seem that she didn't show any appreciation to the husband for doing this for so long.,False
fulfilledHorse: Yeah,False
excitedBison: yeah,False
fulfilledHorse: I think that she hsould be helping - and having 'more time' is a dangerous perception for your significant other to have,False
curiousGorilla: The husband pretty much tried but she was being the selfish one so I'd say she is the asshole,False
"excitedBison: I think she was less dramatic about it, just like ""annoyed at my hubs"" vibe, but that she is also in the wrong here too",False
lightGiraffe: I see the writer side and his side. It makes also feel in between. She was dramatizing it. Her husband did come off a little angry which could cause her reaction.,False
"fulfilledHorse: seemed like it was a small deal for her, but a large one for her spouse. And then she doesn't understand how it's a big deal to him",False
excitedBison: and trying to say that her parents have done enough and dont have to learn is simply ignorant,False
inspiredElephant: They both seem defensive instead of communicating.,False
curiousGorilla: There would probably not have been a problem if both shared the responsibility equally but she pushed it on him,False
excitedBison: EXACTLY ,False
lightGiraffe: They both seemed defensive to me to.,False
excitedBison: on the need to communicate better notion i mean,False
curiousGorilla: The family should also try harder to learn the language of the country they are living in.,False
lightGiraffe: I believe they both needed better communiction on the subject.,False
"fulfilledHorse: I mean, I don't think there is anyone completely in the right - all are at least somewhat wrong",False
"inspiredElephant: I think she is the asshole in the situation as well. Not for being defensive of her parents, but for not being open to her husband about his concerns.",False
fulfilledHorse: ^ agreed,False
"excitedBison: yeah, even if there is no ""official"" language of the land they should know how to communicate with the most used language",False
curiousGorilla: Communication is important but I still don't believe the wife was listening to the husbands side at all,False
excitedBison: Asshole = yupp,False
curiousGorilla: agree,False
lightGiraffe: Agreed. I see both sides being in the wrong.,False
excitedBison: I think we agreed pretty quickly here haha. two wrongs do NOT make a right. ,False
curiousGorilla: That right!,False
"excitedBison: and if we people dont communicate, no one wins",False
lightGiraffe: Agree on that.,False
fulfilledHorse: Communication for the win yo,False
"inspiredElephant: I do not think she was listening, and I think it is very possible that he was communicating poorly as well. They should figure out how to talk to each other and stop being assholes.",False
curiousGorilla: Communication is always the key,False
fulfilledHorse: unless you have a lock - then a key is the key,False
excitedBison: its a fundamental soft skill to any skill,False
lightGiraffe: They should both calm down and talk it out.,False
excitedBison: face to face too not through text/calls,False
curiousGorilla: I stand by my thoughts on this that yes she was being an a hole. ,False
inspiredElephant: Now if we get the mom's perspective in the next one,False
fulfilledHorse: She is an asshole too,False
lightGiraffe: I stand by what I said to.,False
"openElephant: I thought that the person's son was pretty old, and he shouldn't act that way; he's her son but he is an adult not a child.",False
"eagerGiraffe: reading feels incomplete, but it's not something I'd be uncomfortable with in my house",False
novelMonkey: I think the mom could have handled it better.,False
openElephant: If the son is still living with his mom at that age he should show some more respect.,False
lightBison: The mother is asshole for not being a considerate hostess.  She became uncomfortable because she was not intelligent enough to learn a little French before her house guess arrived.,False
"delightedGorilla: I think the mother is wrong. Her son is an adult, has decided on a life partner and appears happy. The mom needs to be big enough to figure out a way to join the conversation without antagonizing the couple.",False
"openElephant: I don't think asking him to speak in a language that she can understand is asking for too much. It is her house, even with a guest over, they should respect the host of the house",False
lightBison: Why didnt the mother ask for them to teach her some French and she teach him some English?,False
"openElephant: They are present together, but if she can't understand them then they are in effect excluding her",False
lightBison: What did she expect if her son had a French husband?\,False
"delightedGorilla: The son could perhaps help the situation by a quick aside to mom; """,False
"eagerGiraffe: I'm wondering if she's feeling excluded in other ways, like her son's not spending any time with her at all",False
novelMonkey: There does seem to be underlying issues.,False
openElephant: Are they in france? is there a reason why her son speaks a different language from his mother?,False
lightBison: You dont think the husband felt excluded being in a English speaking household?,False
lightBison: Im voting asshole,False
delightedGorilla: I'm voting asshole,False
brightBear: This person chose her husband over her mother. Understandable that the mother is upset,False
"delightedDolphin: It seems that if her mother is expressing that she would like to be caught up, there's more she could be doing, regardless of her husband.",False
curiousZebra: I voting not asshole.  When she got married her commitment was with her husband.,False
"brightBear: She spoke in both languages, her mother should accept that her husband is probably more important to her now than her mother used to be.",False
"delightedDolphin: It's possible that her mother is being unreasonable though, hard to say from this.",False
excitedBison: The daughter is the pivot point. She's in a difficult position. She would do better if she explained that her husband is not comfortable in English ,False
"curiousZebra: She only sees her mother every once in while, she wants to keep her husband happy.",False
delightedDolphin: I can certainly understand feeling awkward and concerned about accidentally saying the wrong thing.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: Too hard to tell but seems like a lack of communication.,False
curiousZebra: Seems like everybody is voting not an asshole?,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I am voting not an asshole.,False
curiousZebra: voting not an asshole,False
"brightBear: she spoke in english at least some of the time, but not enough to please her mother",False
"excitedBison: I agree her loyalty has to be to her husband, and she'll just have to continue making her point to her mother.",False
excitedBison: I also am voting not an asshole.,False
brightBear: I too am voting not an asshole,False
curiousZebra: who is voting asshole?,False
brightBear: you?,False
curiousZebra: Ok delightedDolphin whats your vote?,False
"delightedDolphin: I was leaning towards yes, as it's just for a weekend. if her husband is going to be part of his new family, he's going to have to get more comfortable",False
brightGorilla: Not an asshole. they are saying with him for a week at least they can do is just speak english when he is in the same room,False
brightGorilla: staying*,False
"openElephant: Hi! I don't think she's an asshole. If they're with someone, then they ought to speak in a language everyone can understand. If they wanted to say something privately, they could go to a private area.",False
"delightedZebra: I think the parent is not the asshole. They were making it awkward by speaking French, and then blamed the parent for feeling awkward about it.",False
"inquisitiveDolphin: Not an asshole because it is rude to speak a language others don't understand in front of them. That said, maybe she wasn't meant to be part of the conversation.",False
curiousCamel: Me niether because they could possible be say rude or bad things about the person who posted this.,False
fulfilledOtter: Its not rude unless the father was already initially  part of the conversation and they cut him off to speak a different language.,False
eagerBear: I also think the son and husband are the assholes. Especially when they are excluding their host from the conversation.,False
delightedZebra: It is also rude to not include someone in a conversation.,False
"brightGorilla: that is true, inquisitiveDolphin however why would they speak limited English majority of the time",False

delightedOtter: considering her mother is hosting them.,False
"curiousHorse: There are ways to get around the shyness. He could speak to his husband in English and let the husband answer in German, then he translates for his mom.",False

fulfilledCamel: Good point curiousHorse,False
livelyMonkey: Why even visit the family if you do not want to include them into the conversation. ,False

"fulfilledCamel: Right it's not the end of the world if he ""messes up""",False
fulfilledCamel: Whereas doing German only is making a final decision on the matter which creates an awkward environment for all.,False

livelyHorse: novelElephant but the parnter has an accent,False
eagerZebra: Unless the accent is so overpowered (which isn't clarified if it is or isn't) they should use what everyone can understand,False

"excitedMonkey: is she an asshole? Maybe not. But telling somebody they are being disrespectful because they arent speaking a language she doesnt understand, is kind of a dick move",False

excitedCamel: yes the daughter is unreasonable,False
curiousDolphin: the mom could make a gusture and tell the son she would like to learn German giving an opening to be included,False
inquisitiveElephant: Most sons/daughters would want their parents to be comfortable in their own homes.  Why make it awkward for everyone?,False
"openBear: No, I don't think mad is the correct response for the mother ",False

inquisitiveOtter: The mother could've mentioned it privately but it's her house.,False
inspiredHippo: This is very similar to previous situations,False
"novelGiraffe: Given the son's reaction, I doubt it'd hve gone over better if she just talked to the son alone",False
"lightBear: yes, it is her house, which is why i don't think she is the asshole. just could have handled the situation differently",False
"inquisitiveOtter: If she wants to address the guest in her home, she's allowed to.",False
"novelGiraffe: besides, it's not like it's some personal thing or issue she had with the partner. She legit seemed to want both of them to understand their behaviour felt excluding.",False
inspiredHippo: She did say it nicely to them,False
eagerDolphin: I don't think she's the asshole in the situation either,False
eagerDolphin: Exactly it was the exclusion part that bothered her,False
brightHorse: Neither do I. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be included in the conversation.,False
lightBear: novelGiraffe good point,False
inquisitiveOtter: She didn't even attack anyone verbally and she was inclusive in telling them both instead of pulling her son aside I'd say. Something they were not.,False
"novelGiraffe: Exactly inquisitiveOtter -- if it was like 'your partner is doing X and I'd like you to ask them to please stop blowing their nose on the good tablecloth' ok, speak to your son alone.",False
eagerDolphin: Yeah and talking in another language like that makes you think maybe their are talking about you or don't want you to hear...either way doesn't feel good,False
lightBear: i agree eagerDolphin,False
eagerDolphin: they're,False
novelGiraffe: But this is both of them doing it and it's not something one doesn't speak of in polite society or something,False
excitedCamel: She should've just kept asking them to translate what they were saying.,False
"livelyBison: Hi! Yeah I agree, or should've just tried to start conversation in English.",False
"curiousMonkey: I believe that if she invited them to stay in her home, they could have made an effort to speak English to include her. Or she could have asked to speak in English instead to stating that it's disrespectful because she did make it awkward.",False
"inquisitiveHippo: It was plain rude, when I lived in Germany you spoke German unless of course they wanted your cash then they spoke english",False
excitedCamel: Maybe the guy just felt more comfortable to speak in his native language.,False
eagerOtter: The mother should try speaking in English and maybe they'll follow. ,False
excitedCamel: Many ways about it rather than scolding them on being disrespectful.  Silly & rude even though it was her house.,False
inquisitiveHippo: Her son could of translated everything too. But the Husband spoke English,False
"curiousMonkey: She stated that she believed it was disrespectful, and if she asked ""would you mind speaking in English so I can be a part of the conversation?"" maybe things wouldn't have gone the way they did.",False
"livelyBison: Yeah, or maybe emphasize that she didn't like being left out while being in the same room, rather than making it about the language difference.",False
"curiousMonkey: Yes! If her son translated, that would be a way for his native husband to continue speaking French.",False
eagerOtter: I agree. A nicer approach of telling them she wants to converse with them as well would have been better,False
"excitedCamel: Very true.  Plus, depending on how strong his accent was, she may have trouble understanding him anyways.",False
"livelyBison: True, unless they were talking about something private, in which case that would be kind of rude to do with someone in the same room",False
"inquisitiveHippo: with that said, they are grown men and I say the husband did it on purpose to get at the MIL",False
excitedCamel: Grown man of 20.,False
"curiousMonkey: I think that if she isn't fluent in French, her son and his husband also could have helped her learn a few phrases as well. She should make an effort herself to begin to learn the language, too for their sake.",False
"inquisitiveHippo: Coming from immigrants, my Great Grandmother would not let the native tongue be spoken unless all in the room could speak it.",False
inquisitiveHippo: I don't think that the mom was an asshole ,False
"livelyBison: I think she was maybe wrong in the way she went about expressing it, but yeah I think she was just feeling left out and uncomfortable.",False
curiousMonkey: They should respect the language spoken in her house since she invited them to stay for a week.,False
eagerOtter: It's understandable to be felt left out if all they spoke was French,False
"fulfilledHippo: I don't think this person was being an asshole, more just kind of stuck in an uncomfortable position.",False
lightGiraffe: I think he should've been translating for his mom so she could be part of the conversation.,False
openMonkey: I think that since mom was nice enough to host them they should be speaking English for the most part and if the the husband get stuck he could ask the son how to translate what he wanted to convey,True
"fulfilledHippo: Yeah I understand why the mother would be upset too, it would have helped for him to translate",False
lightGiraffe: I agree.  It was just awkward.  The hubs should've tried a bit harder.,False
"delightedOtter: I believe that since the mother invited her son and his partner, they should make sure she is somehow included in the conversation. Either by translation or by English.",False
brightElephant: It's only for the weekend and he hasn't seen his mother for a while. They should have tried to speak English or the husband should have translated,False
lightGiraffe: A lot of selfishness the whole way around but no real a$$holes.,False
"delightedOtter: I think she should make sure that her son's husband feels welcome and that he shouldn't be embarrassed if he messes up while speaking English. They're family, they shouldn't care",False
"fulfilledHippo: I can also imagine that in the flow of a conversation, he might just not have thought to stop and translate every single back and forth.",False
"openMonkey: I have never know any German to be shy about how they speak, not to mention any German born after WWII were taught English throughout shcool",True
"delightedOtter: English is a difficult language to learn, but if English is the language spoken at his mother's house, it should be the language spoken by all out of respect",False
lightGiraffe: Especially since they live in the US part-time.,False
openMonkey: Exactly and it appears that the son speaks German in Germany. In this day and age there is nothing to be embarrassed about an accent ,True
"fulfilledHippo: I think it was kind of rude to not include his mother, but it seems like it wasn't an intentionally mean-spirited thing.",False
delightedOtter: He should try to encourage his husband to practice while they're home and should talk to his mom to make sure she doesn't create a judgey environment if he messes up.,False
delightedOtter: (He should encourage him to speak English in the U.S. is what I meant),False
openMonkey: Or the husband could be judgmental of the Mother in law,True
brightElephant: The son wanted to make his husband comfortable and didn't consider his mother's feelings. The mother could have tried conversing them in English more. I don't anyone's an asshole .,False
"delightedZebra: I don't think that the person is the asshole, I think the husband is.",False
openMonkey: The husband is in the wrong here,False
novelGiraffe: I think this person is the asshole for making fun of him,False
delightedZebra: I think asking a spouse to help your family out for 10 minutes at a time once in a while is not a big deal at all.,False
novelGiraffe: True,False
eagerOtter: I think that if she can say her husband can take 10 mins out of his time why can’t she ,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I feel he is not an asshole because I don't think it is too much to ask that his husband help out family from time to time. ,False
novelGiraffe: But can't she translate as well?,False
delightedZebra: If this was something where the husband was being bothered nonstop then I would understand it.,False
eagerOtter: Or at least they can alternate who steps up and translates ,False
curiousBear: I think the daughter is the asshole for thinking her husband should be responsible most of the time for the translation.,False
delightedZebra: She can translate it but the way she explained it was she didn't have time.,False
eagerOtter: I agree it doesn’t sound like it’s constant for the husband ,False
excitedHorse: It's hard to tell how often teh husband is really bing asked to do things,False
delightedZebra: She is working full time and is going for her masters degree.,False
novelGiraffe: She seems pretty entitled.,False
openMonkey: apparently the husband has a lot of freetime ,False
delightedZebra: Exactly excitedHorse I agree.,False
delightedZebra: We really need more information on how often the husband is actually being asked to translate.,False
eagerOtter: Yes but she still should make time for her family ,False
inquisitiveDolphin: If I were the husband I wouldn't mind helping out time to time. ,False
eagerOtter: Maybe the husband works a lot too we don’t know ,False
"excitedHorse: If it's like an every day thing, then she's the asshole. If it's like sometimes the parents call on the weekends for help with something, he should just do it.",False
"delightedZebra: But the way she explained it, 10 minutes once in a while...that's not a big deal at all.",False
novelGiraffe: Agreed,False
inquisitiveDolphin: Agreed,False
eagerOtter: Agree ,False
delightedZebra: This is one of those situations where it's kind of impossible to accuractely judge.,False
novelGiraffe: I do not like that he expects the parents to learn English now,False
delightedZebra: We need the husbands point of view too,False
"curiousBear: Although she is working and attending school, I think she should not completely abdicate her responsibility to help translate and not put the full responsibility on the husband.",False
"excitedHorse: But she also could be trying to make it sound like it's less than it is, lol",False
openMonkey: yes we do need his point of view,False
novelGiraffe: very true delightedZebra,False
eagerOtter: Agree,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I think hearing his side would help ,False
"delightedZebra: With the information we were given, he's more in the wrong IMO",False
delightedZebra: Probably more to the story but that's all we were given,False
inquisitiveDolphin: Yes,False
novelGiraffe: Sounds like the parents don't even call her anymore!,False
"excitedHorse: If her story is totally accurate, maybe he is the asshole. I'm not totally sure though.",False
"curiousBear: Even at their age, the parents could be encouraged to learn English.  It would be a worthwhile project in my opinion.  ",False
delightedZebra: Yeah it's impossible to know for sure.,False
delightedZebra: I do think the parents should try to learn English though.,False
delightedZebra: At least give it a chance as it would make their lives easier too.,False
novelGiraffe: Do we think she is the asshole?,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I do see how she needs more time for her family but I still think the husband is in the wrong.,False
"excitedHorse: Oh yeah, they definitely should. It sounds like they've been in the US for 10 years.",False
openMonkey: there is a lot of tools to make learning a new language easier,False
delightedZebra: I do not think she is,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I don't ,False
eagerOtter: I agree they should learn but if they need help should be able to ask their daughter or son in law once in a while,False
novelGiraffe: I have changed my mind and now I think she is not an asshole anymore,False
eagerOtter: Agree ,False
inquisitiveDolphin: agree,False
openMonkey: agree,False
"excitedHorse: Okay, let's go with that",False
delightedZebra: I just don't think someone being asked to sacrifice 10 minutes of their time on a phone call is a big ask of someone,False
curiousBear: I do understand the husband's reluctance to be the translator but he could probably be somewhat more helpful and kind in offering help.  ,False
"delightedZebra: So she isn't the asshole, he is.",False
delightedZebra: At least according to the info we got,False
inquisitiveDolphin: She is not an asshole. ,False
openMonkey: yes from the picture she painted the husband is the asshole,False
inquisitiveDolphin: Until I see other info lol,False
"novelGiraffe: But we are being asked if she is the asshole, correct?",False
"curiousBear: I, too, can agree that perhaps the daughter is not the asshole but the family needs to work out a system where one person is not charged with the responsibility of translating most of the time.  ",False
inquisitiveDolphin: This person is not an asshole. ,False
delightedZebra: We're being asked if she is the asshole.,False
delightedZebra: And she is not in my opinion.,False
"excitedHorse: Yeah, we're being asked if the author is the asshole",False
inquisitiveDolphin: She did not ask too much of her husband I feel so she is not an asshole to me. ,False
eagerOtter: I agree she is not an asshole ,False
curiousHorse: I don't think this person is the asshole.,False
fulfilledBison: This guy is totally an asshole,False
novelElephant: I don’t think so he said he was respectful ,False
"curiousHorse: I think after he explained that he was willing to help and was polite and respectful, he cleared himself of being the asshole.",False
excitedHippo: what he said wasn't respectful,False
curiousHorse: It's not his responsibility to be a translator 24 hours a day.,False
novelElephant: I think he would still be willing to help just they also need to commit to learning english,False
curiousHorse: If it was every once in a while it would be understandable.,False
livelyZebra: I think the way the guy talked was like an asshole but if he spoke respectfully to his mother in law about learning English he wasn't one in the situation.,False
"eagerMonkey: I think he came off harsh because of his language, but he actually sounded kind of sincere",False
"fulfilledBison: I think when dealing with family members, it should have been the wife that said something, not him",False
curiousHorse: He also said he was willing to help the mother in law any way he could.,False
excitedHippo: but if he is being called randomly throughout the whole day its a problem,False
delightedCamel: I also believe he is an asshole .  I do not think he was respectful in dealing with his MIL.,True
novelElephant: Yes it Is not clear how often he is being asked to help ,False
"fulfilledBison: Just because he learned languages easily, does not mean that the mother in law will",False
livelyZebra: Honestly it would be hard to deal with calls all day if she can't even order food for herself so I get the frustration. ,False
curiousHorse: I agree with that fulfilledBison,False
excitedHippo: agreed,False
curiousHorse: But that doesn't mean she shouldn't at least try to learn the language.,False
"delightedCamel: Even though he said he was willing to help the MIL, he tone and words were disrespectful in my opinion.",True
"eagerMonkey: Barely being able to order food at a restaurant is really bad though, lol.",False
novelElephant: Yes that is true may be harder for his mother in law to learn but she should at least try ,False
"curiousHorse: It seems like she doesn't even want to learn, she just wants everything done her way and in her language.",False
livelyZebra: But I know not everyone learns English easily or any other language. ,False
curiousHorse: That's just not the reality in the USA,False
"eagerMonkey: Like I can understand needs help with taxes or applying for something but if you can't interact with people at the store or something, that's a real pain.",False
excitedHippo: yeah she definitely should learn some of the very basics though ,False
"curiousHorse: If she put effort into learning and just wasn't getting it, I'd be way more understanding.",False
curiousHorse: The guy is probably getting calls all day about how to translate very minor things.,False
livelyZebra: I can see both sides but he sounded so harsh I think it puts people off.,False
novelElephant: Yes I agree his tone is bad ,False
curiousHorse: I just think everyone has a breaking point.,False
curiousHorse: His tone was bad but he also cleared it up and said he was polite and respectful.,False
"fulfilledBison: What does flaunting ""white priveledge"" have to do with anything?",False
delightedCamel: It would be a good thing if the mother in law used available resources to learn English.  It would probably ease the tensions.,True
novelElephant: But if he really was respectful to her then I don’t think he’s the asshole ,False
curiousHorse: I just don't think he's an asshole.,False
eagerMonkey: But I think his tone and language being bad is something we should kind of ignore. It makes him look worse than maybe he's really acting.,False
livelyZebra: I don't either,False
excitedHippo: seems like he is being called all day and it just got to him I don't think he is the asshole,False
curiousHorse: Asking someone to try to learn a language is 100% a fine thing to do,False
curiousHorse: Not trying and just using someone as a translator 24/7 is wrong,False
eagerMonkey: I would say not the asshole too.,False
delightedCamel: He thinks he was respectful but I disagree.  He could have phrased it more kindly. ,True
curiousHorse: I highly doubt this guy is flipping out over translating a few things a month,False
novelElephant: Yes I agree not the asshole ,False
"fulfilledBison: But he said that the mother in law ""sometimes"" calls.",False
curiousHorse: It has to be quite often for him to be this frustrated,False
fulfilledBison: It doesn't sound like she calls as much as is told,False
curiousHorse: It's hard to say.,False
novelElephant: Yes or he has a low breaking point ,False
livelyZebra: Yeah I could see it being very annoying after awhile,False
curiousHorse: I just don't think someone would be getting mad being called like 2-3 times a month,False
fulfilledBison: And she calls when she can't get ahold of someone else,False
fulfilledBison: So she doesn't even call him first,False
delightedCamel: The MIH should be strongly encouraged to learn English and the family should be supportive.  Perhaps she lacks confidence and needs someone to encourage her.  ,True
curiousHorse: The last thing someone wants to do when they get home from work is be hounded and having to do things that they don't want to do,False
curiousHorse: We all just want to relax,False
curiousHorse: This person is not the asshole in my opinion.,False
curiousHorse: I don't think the mother in law is either.,False
excitedHippo: She should attempt to learn english,False
curiousHorse: I just think there's no asshole in this situation.,False
novelElephant: I still don’t think the person in the assshole based on what we know ,False
livelyZebra: I don't think they are an asshole and I feel she should at least try to learn English. ,False
curiousHorse: Same livelyZebra,False
fulfilledBison: This was a hard scenario!,False
fulfilledZebra: I think they both were assholes to be honest,False
"novelDolphin: I think she is the asshole in this case, ",False
openBison: I think they both were having a hard time seeing things from the other person's point of view.,False
eagerOtter: I think he is the asshole,False
fulfilledZebra: They can come to a conclusion together on this. She shouldn't expect him to drop everything.,False
novelDolphin: it was one thing once in a while to have the mom ask him directly but to do is consistantly that should be her responsibility or at least split it,False
"delightedGiraffe: I think if he was uncomfortable with the task, then she was an asshole for continuing to put this on him.",False
delightedGiraffe: There are lots of translation apps out there.,False
eagerOtter: I think she shouldn,False
novelDolphin: I also stand with fulfilledZebra ,False
openBison: She was very busy working and school full time but she wasn't willing to see his point of view that he wasn't comfortable with her mom calling him directly. However it would have been nice if he could understand how busy she was.,False
"delightedGiraffe: Yes, they were both assholes.",False
novelDolphin: great point delightedGiraffe,False
fulfilledZebra: maybe they could work together to teach her parents more english,False
openBison: Helping her parents become more proficient in English would be a good goal for both of them.,False
openBison: Or all four of them rather.,False
delightedGiraffe: She does state that it was once in a while and not a daily occurence,False
excitedHorse: I think he is the asshole. He might have asked nicely and communicate his concerns. On the other hand she is being melodramatic without seating and talking with him. When you get married there are some things that need to be compromised.,False
"fulfilledZebra: Considering we aren't sure of his tone when he said he was uncomfortable with this, we could assume maybe he didn't speak up soon enough and has let it go on. ",False
fulfilledZebra: so he could be mildly at fault for not standing up for himself too,False
eagerOtter: I think she shouldn't put him in that position where he is getting irritated. Of course he's her husband and her family is like his family but it doesn't matter the situation is.,False
delightedGiraffe: they both should be more understanding of each other.,False
"fulfilledZebra: She definitely shouldn't just ""expect"" things because they're married. Communication is key. agreed eagerotter ",False
"openBison: I chose her as the AH but I really didn't think either was, they are both being defensive and not seeing the other person's point of view. ",False
novelDolphin: I still think she is the asshole and they both need to come to an agreement on how to solve the problem together so neither are overburdened ,False
fulfilledZebra: open,False
fulfilledZebra: openBison I got that feeling too,False
fulfilledZebra: There is a middleground in there!,False
delightedGiraffe: so do we all agree that they are both equally at fault?,False
eagerOtter: and also he shouldn't get irritated for helping out the eldest its not like they know because if they do know on their own they wouldn't even bother for his help,False
openBison: So how many chose her as AH? ,False
fulfilledZebra: I would say so,False
delightedGiraffe: yes,False
eagerOtter: I think he is the Asshole,False
fulfilledZebra: Definitely vote how you feel,False
novelBear: This guy is definitely an asshole,False
"openMonkey: He does seem like he is the AH but his note at the end made it seem that he didn't actually say those harsh words to his MIL, which would have definitely made hime the AH.",False
"livelyCamel: I think hes not the asshole in this, the wife should take some more responsibility for her mother or help her become more independant",False
novelBear: I feel like the inconveniences he describes aren't something to be so upset about...is it truly interrupting his day THAT BADLY,False
delightedDolphin: This man is an asshole. First he should respect his wife's parents. If they did not learn any English he needs to understand their age and how difficult it is. On the other hand he should first discuss it with his wife. ,False
"lightOtter: This guy is not an asshole for not wanting to be interrupted multiple times during his day, at work, wherever, to translate for someone who could download a translation app or learn the language or any number of ther things.",False
"livelyCamel: to open openMonkey point: so long as he really didnt word it that harshly, hes not the asshole",False
novelBear: He does need to show a little more patience considering their age. It's much harder to absorb and learn a new language,False
livelyCamel: but there is so many resources they can use ,False
lightOtter: He has been translating for them for 8 years. He was kind and respectful when asking them to learn the language and even offered to help.,False
livelyCamel: many FREE,False
delightedDolphin: He is an asshole on the way he is talking to them. Complaining is not a thing that makes you better. He should become better on the way he talks to others and helping others,False
"novelBear: He has to remember that older people are going to call and ask questions about all sorts of things, why is the language thing the problem?",False
openMonkey: But who is the AH? The parents are older and it may be hard for them to use the technology he suggests.,False
livelyCamel: you shouldnt be considered an asshole for politely asking someone to try and be more independant,False
"novelBear: Unless he physically shows them how to use the programs hes told them about, it's not going to benefit them",False
openMonkey: I think no one is an AH just everyone is having a hard time.,False
livelyCamel: lol good point openMonkey,False
livelyCamel: I do agree he should help them become more independant.,False
"openMonkey: Since we have to choose I guess I will have to choose him, but under duress.",False
lightOtter: The language thing is the problem because it is unnecessary and unthoughtful. Maybe he's in the middle of something at work which is crucial and there goes his cell phoone ringing to ask for a translation.,False
novelBear: I felt the same way. I think there is just a communication breakdown and someone isn't talking about their feelings,False
novelBear: He could definitely set up boundaries,False
"openMonkey: True, then he wouldn't be so frustrated.",False
novelBear: setting up boundaries is more appropriate and healthy than doing what he did ,False
livelyCamel: Boundaries are key in any relationship and in this scenario they clearly need to be developed.,False
lightOtter: He offered to help them become more independent. He has been offering his assistance all along. Now it's time for someone else to let him off the hook and become more independent. He is not the asshole.,False
"fulfilledCamel: Hi guys. How are we all feeling about this situation? I am leaning towards he's the asshole, since he sounds pretty clueless.",False
inspiredMonkey: Hello. I am inclined to think this young man is somewhat of an asshole as well.,False
inspiredMonkey: He's very clueless and disrespectful.,False
"fulfilledCamel: Yeah, he sounds young and like he doesn't realize that those resources he quoted cost inspiredMonkey which she may not have.",False
eagerHorse:            ,False
"fulfilledCamel: money, not inspiredMonkey lol",False
"livelyDolphin: I think he is not, Yes that was abit disrespectful, but 8 years is a long time, let the mother in law learn some English.",False
"curiousGiraffe: I feel that he's an asshole because although I get it can be annoying to always be needed, he sounds a bit insensitive.   ",False
"inspiredMonkey: Plus, many, many, first generation immigrants don't learn the language. Not just in the U.S., but any other country they migrate to. ",False
"fulfilledCamel: Some people have a talent for languages, which it looks like he does. Most Americans never have to learn another language when they travel, so they feel like everyone should know English anyway.",False
"lightGorilla: I'm having a hard time with this one. I've done much work with international students and I expect that when we're all in a group setting, we speak a language that everyone is able to understand and participate with (not always english)",False
inspiredMonkey: Absolutely insensistive curiousGiraffe ,False
livelyDolphin: He learnt Spanish,False
eagerHorse:       ,False
inquisitiveElephant: I think this person is the asshole not because of how he feels but because of how he handled the situation. ,False
inquisitiveElephant: nstead of telling her he's tired of helping her he should have maybe offered to help her in other ways. Like maybe help her download an app that helps translate or maybe sign her up for english classes ,False
eagerHorse:     inquisitiveElephant   ,False
"fulfilledCamel: Yes, agreed. He could have had his wife intervene and put it to the MIL in another way rather than him being blunt about it.",False
"inspiredMonkey: Or, he could have started meeting with her every evening and going over basic Enlish.",False
fulfilledCamel: Or offered to pay for some of those classes/apps. ,False
eagerHorse: ,False
"lightGorilla: I think if they're going to accuse him of flaunting his white privilege they need to acknowledge that they're taking advantage of the work he put in, but I also think He could have been more polite.",False
"curiousGiraffe: Right, that was my take on it too. The way that it was said seems off putting.  ",False
"fulfilledCamel: On the one hand, he does have a point, but he could have gone about it a better way.",False
"inspiredMonkey: Yes, it was very off putting.",False
lightGorilla: I'm about 50/50 on this one.,False
"livelyDolphin: I have no problem with what he was trying to accomplish, it was abit disrespectful though.",False
eagerHorse: ,False
"fulfilledCamel: Right, he's the asshole, if only because he could have gone about it a better way.",False
lightGorilla: @lively livelyDolphin I totally agree,False
inspiredMonkey: I'm voting for asshole becasue he was so insensitive and bunt.,False
livelyDolphin: True,False

livelyDolphin: Lets give him some credit he learnt Spanish,False
inquisitiveElephant: I'm voting he's an asshole ,False
livelyDolphin: Am voting he's not,False
"curiousGiraffe: And also, seeing how the family isn't really liking him - there's probably more to this story and/or he really is an ass. ",False
fulfilledCamel: That's why I'm saying he's an asshole at a 55/45 ratio versus outright 90/10 he's an asshole.,False
"fulfilledCamel: I'm giving him credit overall, but not for how he handled the particular situation.",False

lightGorilla: But percentages aren't an option in the vote.,False

"fulfilledCamel: No, they're not lightGorilla but the point is whether he's an asshole or not. And I think he is, just by a little.",False
"delightedCamel: Hello all. I'm thinking she is not the asshole in this scenario, since her husband has more time that he could try to teach them English himself maybe?",False
excitedElephant: I don't believe this young woman is an asshole. She's just not communicating clearly with her husband and now they have encountered a problem.,False
openGorilla: I feel that she is an asshole because the way she's talking about she's making her husband translate. I get that it's tough for immigrants and it's nice for him to help out but she shouldn't expect him to do it. ,False

"delightedCamel: True, but he could try to help them by maybe getting them the app or having her do it if they'd be more receptive instead of just calling his wife an aasshole.",False
"excitedElephant: He needs to enroll them in ESL if nothing else. I don't think it costs that much, but I don't know.",False
delightedCamel: excitedElephant agree about the lack of communication. It's a language and culture shock that they nee to come to terms with.,False
"openGorilla: She can certainly ask him if he can help but she shouldn't expect him to do it. I feel that if they can sit and have a conversation on expectations, that will be helpful. But it's rude make someone do something.",False
"eagerHippo: delightedCamel i think it is possible for a husband and wife to have a disagreement or miscommunication without either of them being the ""asshole.'",False
excitedElephant: I agree delightedCamel ,False
"curiousDolphin: Doing the translations once in a while is okay, but having to translate all the time is frustrating, let them learn some simple English.",True
"delightedCamel: eagerHippo the prompt said that the husband was calling her ""The Asshole"" for having his mom call him, so that's why she was asking if she was the asshole.",False
eagerHippo: I didn't anyone in this situation calling anyone else an asshole,False
"delightedCamel: curiousDolphin I agree that it's frustrating, but there's better ways to go about this than complaining to your wife and being a jerk about it.",False
excitedElephant: I think he needs to help his MIL find a way to learn English and encourage her along.,False
"delightedCamel: eagerHippo per the excerpt""My husband has gotten increasingly irritated and says I'm TA """,False
delightedCamel: eag,False
delightedCamel: eagerHippo TA stands for the Asshole. He was calling his wife the asshole.,False
"eagerHippo: Okay, whatever, already voted so it doesn't matter",False

curiousDolphin: Don't compare others to your ability or time frames,False

"excitedGorilla: Right, I think we should go with ""not an asshole"".",False
fulfilledElephant: I agree eight years is a long time to learn the language. But I think some people have much of a difficult time learning,False

curiousDolphin: What about kids they learn at different rates and soeeds,False
curiousDolphin: Speeds,False
livelyBear: Agreed - NOT an asshole,False
"inquisitiveZebra: I don't think he was an asshole for his thoughts, but handled it poorly.",False
"excitedGorilla: She doesn't have to learn English, but she should not be relying on him so much if it's a hassle for him.",False
livelyBear: I think his mother in law is afraid to learn English - he should offer to help her,False
"delightedCamel: He married the daughter, not the mom. She can hire a translator. Why is that his job every day for the rest of his life?",False
"fulfilledElephant: Some people can immigrate and live in the country for years, and what if they never had an education? Wouldn't that make it much more difficult to learn the language",False
"excitedGorilla: He did offer ideas for resources and tell her about ESL classes, I thought that was helpful...",False
fulfilledElephant: There was nothing that said he was the translator every day for the rest of his life,False
delightedCamel: He said he did offer her all the tools he used. He likely works for a living and does not have time to teach a class.,False
curiousDolphin: But what about the other family members why are they not helping?,False
excitedGorilla: Does anyone think he was an asshole?,False
livelyBear: so everyone type your vote - asshole or not an asshole,False

livelyHippo: 8 years I think,False
"delightedElephant: They've been here a long time though, she arrived at age 15 and now she's married",False
"curiousMonkey: This writing made me think that she is not an asshole totally as she says her husband has been helpful in bridging gaps in the past, but underpressure with school and being an asshole in expecting him to do this all the time.",False
lightGiraffe: Yeah needs effort,False
excitedOtter: I think he is justified in his feeling.,False

eagerHorse: why is the person an asshole?,True
eagerHorse: Hello?,True
livelyCamel: I don't think the writer is an asshole.  But I think he/she could be a little more considerate of the spouse.,False
"inquisitiveBear: Every now and then would be okay, but just expecting the husband to drop what he's doing at any given time to translate is just inconsiderate and rude of the writer.",False

livelyCamel: I also think the writer should help and encourage the parents to learn English,False
"brightMonkey: That's understandable, but it really is a difficult to encourage Spanish parents to learn English",True
eagerHorse: I think that the parents should learn english too but in the mean time they do not know it,True
inquisitiveBear: It would get annoying when you are in the middle of something and out of the blue you have to take your focus away from what you're doing to handle the business of people who really should have learned english.,False
eagerHorse: So the husband could help they did say it was once in a while,True
"delightedBison: I understand and agree with that, it doesn't really matter if they ""aren't doing much anyway"", thrusting something upon someone is just plain rude.",False
livelyCamel: I think that the writer and the spouse could help the parents to learn English.  I believe that if you truly want to have a successful life in a foreign country you should try to learn the native language.,False
"inquisitiveBear: It should be the hard and fast rule that if you want to be a citizen of America, then you must learn english to do so.",False

eagerHorse: so what do we agree,True
"livelyCamel: Yes, perhaps there is a little bit of laziness there. And the husband is resentful.",False

"inquisitiveBear: Like previously stated, it should just be the law that everyone wanting to be a citizen has to learn english.]",False
livelyCamel: The writer is an asshole. I'm ready to vote.,False
inquisitiveBear: Printing everything in a bunch of languages in this country costs us so many 100's of millions a year,False
curiousZebra: This person is not an asshole.,False
openBison: I feel he is an asshole,False
"curiousZebra: He is entitled to his opinion, which he expressed respectfully.",False
"inquisitiveCamel: The writer is most definitely NOT an asshole, and is totally in the right.",False
"excitedElephant: I feel like what they said is rather ""asshole-y"", but they have a point.",False
delightedHippo: I dont feel that he is the asshole,False
openBison: I understand his frustrations but he is in the family and should help when he can,False
curiousZebra: He is helping.  ,False
"excitedElephant: Like it's definitely rude to force someone to be ""on call"" for translation efforts, but the way he flaunted hi fluency in other languages comes off as super pretentious.",False
openBison: he is trying to but he is making it out so much harder than it is,False
"inquisitiveCamel: Try to imagine that you are in the middle of something important that requires your full attention, and have to be interrupted to translate for those who wanted to be Americans, but do not bother to learn english.",False
delightedHippo: I completely relate to that,False
openBison: he is the asshole though,False
"curiousZebra: He was trying to make a point, that learning a language is is a choice that anyone can make.",False
inquisitiveCamel: The wife and the parents are the assholes for expecting him to drop what he is doing whenever they want to use him to translate. ,False
openBison: he could have been nicer about it all,False
"excitedElephant: Like ""if I can do it they sure can"" but it's not all black and white",False
"inquisitiveCamel: The wife would be the biggest asshole, for being so inconsiderate of her husband's time and feelings.",False
delightedHippo: He could have been nicer but this is also years of frustration pilled up,False
curiousZebra: Why do you think he was not nice? He said that he was respectful.,False
"excitedElephant: he's not necessarily ""the asshole"" for what he did, but HOW he responded and wrote the post",False
"inquisitiveCamel: The parents sound lazy any entitled. It is not ""white privilege"" (what a f'ing joke that term is anyways- where's MY white privilege?) They just feel it is easier to have someone do it for them.",False
delightedHippo: He seems like an asshole but he wasn't the asshole here,False
curiousZebra: He is clearly frustrated and feels like he is being taken advantage of. He expressed this. That doesn't make him an asshole.,False
inquisitiveCamel: He was polite and made very good points as to why they should learn english.,False
openBison: the wife should be more in this ,False
openBison: I do not feel he was polite,False
"inquisitiveCamel: He is being used and taken advantage of him. Maybe this guy needs to find a better wife who will consider his feelings too, not just here lazy parents.",False
openBison: I do feel he was an asshole however,False
"inquisitiveCamel: ""her",False
inquisitiveCamel: *her,False
curiousZebra: Why not? He said that he was respectful to his inlaws.,False
excitedElephant: Everyone who isn't respectful says they're respectful,False
"inquisitiveCamel: Yes he was, and wants them to have the ability to do for themselves, for both of their sakes.",False
eagerMonkey: In my opinion this person is the asshole.,False
excitedHorse: I think this person is the asshole as well.,False
livelyZebra: I think the person is the asshole because they've chosen to not speak english when they all can.,False
fulfilledElephant: i think this person is the asshole too ,False
curiousCamel: My initial impression is there is a huge misunderstanding between OP and his mom. She may not know the whole situation as to why his husband refuses to speak English.,False
"excitedHorse: Yes, especially since the visit was specifically to be with his mother and it's in her home.",False
novelBear: I believe the person is the asshole.,False
"eagerMonkey: If the mother is graciously letting them stay at the house, they should be speaking english if that's what she wants or they can go elsewhere",False
livelyZebra: And she's feeding them and taking care of them,False
fulfilledElephant: The husband can speak some English but I think its a bigger factor that the son spoke mostly German.,False
excitedHorse: The husband is never going to get comfortable with it if he doesn't start trying to speak english .,False
"eagerMonkey: The mother cares about her son and wants to catch up, and he's being rude and not letting her do that. ",False
fulfilledElephant: He could carve out more time to include his mom and catch up rather than speak almost exclusively in German.,False
livelyZebra: I think they're both assholes.,False
curiousCamel: You make a decent point. The son could have easily translated for his mother as well,False
eagerMonkey: I agree that the husband won't be able to become comfortable with it if he doesn't practice ,False
"novelBear: The husband should understand the mom's POV because she is providing them housing and meals, even though it makes him uncomfortable. The mom just wants to understand them.",False
excitedHorse: It's not like he's giving a speech in front of a bunch of strangers. Its his mother in law.,False
"eagerMonkey: They could have all had a talk about it, instead of him throwing a fit and posting on the internet about it",False
livelyZebra: I know the mom feels totally left out,False
fulfilledElephant: I think it's ultimately about trying to balance the attention to his mom and husband but his mom definitely deserves more attention than she got since they are visiting her.,False
eagerMonkey: The mom might think they're talking about her if they have the ability to speak english but don't. it might make her feel uncomfortable as well. ,False
excitedHorse: True. Should never post family business on the internet in my opinion,False
"novelBear: Agreed, they should at least include her as she is providing them housing and meals.",False
"livelyZebra: If you've ever been in a room where everyone is speaking a language you don't speak, it's very isolating.",False
fulfilledElephant: I think the moms POV is very understandable,False
eagerMonkey: The son is whiny. He should be considering both sides and work to make a compromise,False
fulfilledElephant: I agree,False
curiousCamel: Maybe they should try teaching her German while working on improving the husbands so he can see how it is from her end as well,False
"livelyZebra: He should have at least spoken in english and if hubs wanted to speak in german, he could translate",False
novelBear: It is indeed very isolating when you are in a room where everyone is speaking a language that you don't understand. You just want to be included.,False
excitedHorse: Good idea. But it may be harder for her to learn a new language if she's older,False
eagerMonkey: I agree ,False
livelyZebra: Yes this person is the asshole for not speaking english to his mom.,False
excitedHorse: Yes this person is the asshole. He is at his mother's visiting and should put her needs first. ,False
fulfilledElephant: I agree. This person is the asshole and should've considered his mom's POV more,False
delightedZebra: I don't think she was being an asshole,False
livelyBear: I don't think this person is the asshole. I think the son was in this situation.,False
fulfilledHippo: I believe it was more the son being the asshole,False
curiousElephant: I don't either. Everyone could speak english so they should have to be polite,False
delightedZebra: I agree ,False
openGiraffe: I don't think the mother is being the asshole. ,False
inspiredMonkey: She wasn't being the asshole at all.,False
livelyBear: They were staying at her home anyway so they shouldn't exclude her ,False
openGiraffe: They are all in her house and they all speak English. ,False
fulfilledHippo: It sounded like the partner was having a bit of a childish fit,False
"delightedZebra: It's her house, so if she wants them to speak english and they are capable of doing so, they should speak english ",False
"inspiredMonkey: If they are in her house, they should at least speak English so that she could understand. They could all speak english.",False
curiousElephant: I think it was an intentional snub,False
"livelyBear: I understand if when the son and husband are alone they speak French, but when they are all together they should speak English.",False
"delightedZebra: If it was really that big of an issue the son could have translated for them, but it seems like the partner was being a baby",False
openGiraffe: Especially once they knew she was uncomfortable with it.,False
inspiredMonkey: Wouldn't anyone else feel isolated if everyone else in the room spoke a language that you couldn't understand? ,False
curiousElephant: They were purposefully excluding her from the conversation. It was rude behavior.,False
livelyBear: I also think she handled it well telling them she felt disrespected and their reactions were a little extreme,False
delightedZebra: It's part of life for people to disagree. if the mother was respsectful with what she said the partner shouldn't have just barged off and threw a fit,False
delightedZebra: I agree that she handled it well,False
delightedZebra: The only thing i think was wrong of the mother was to turn around and post about it on the internet ,False
delightedZebra: But she had the right to feel the way that she did. ,False
"inspiredMonkey: It was really disrespectful for them to go upstairs after she said said. And the son was being the asshole for calling her rude because it is ""awkward""",False
openGiraffe: Right. Never post family business on the internet. Never turns out well.,False
fulfilledHippo: She did ask nicely. The son should have apologized and spoken to his partner about his behavior.,False
livelyBear: If the son and husband really felt like it was that big of a deal then they should have explained their side too.,False
openGiraffe: Who knows maybe they were discussing something they didn't want her to know. A surprise party or something.,False
delightedZebra: The son and the husband are not being grateful to the mother. they could be paying for a hotel room every night ,False
livelyBear: But the mom definitely had a right to feel disrespected and isolated in her own home,False
curiousElephant: The partner showed poor manners.,False
"delightedZebra: You're right, we don't know the entire story",False
fulfilledHippo: If the conversation needed to be that private they could have taken it to another room,False
delightedZebra: although the partner still shouldn't have barged off ,False
delightedZebra: agree with fu,False
delightedZebra: fulfilledHippo ,False
"inspiredMonkey: If they were discussing something like a surprise why would they go upstairs? Or the son, why would he say that it's disrespectful for her to make it awkward",False
delightedZebra: and the son could have said that they needed to have a private conversation ,False
delightedZebra: another good point inspiredMonkey,False
inspiredMonkey: How they handled it was disrespectful,False
livelyBear: I think it was a poorly handled situation that probably just needed communication and a full conversation.,False
curiousElephant: Speaking only french was a way to exclude the mother. he was doing that on purpose.,False
fulfilledHippo: It would have been better if he had communicated that instead of getting defensive,False
delightedZebra: very disrespectful ,False
curiousElephant: The person is not the asshole. She politely asked that they be respectful and include her in the conversation.,False
fulfilledHippo: I agree she is not,False
openGiraffe: This person is not the asshole.,False
livelyBear: Agreed. This person is not the asshole.,False
openGiraffe: The other 2 handled the situation poorly. Not her.,False
openZebra: Hello everyone,False
"eagerBear: I don't think she's an asshole, just inconsiderate for not asking her husband if he was okay with it.",False
inspiredGiraffe: hello,False
lightBison: I think that she is able to translate for her parents and her husband shouldn't be expected to do it all the time,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I do not think she is the asshole, yet. If she keeps sending her parent's translation q's to her husband after he expressed his concern, I'd say she was ",False
inspiredGiraffe: I think the writer's husband is being a bit too inflexible here.,False
"eagerBear: Yes, she should talk to her mother about it.",False
novelOtter: I think the word making at the end really got to me. Making the husband translate put her in the wrong. If she was asking or if it was only occasionally that would be different.,False
lightBison: although he did not react in an appropriate manner,False
inquisitiveCamel: She can't assume her husband has the same family values she does (or should have figured that out before tieing the knot) -),False
eagerBear: How many things can she need to translate? I can't image it is all day long.,False
inspiredGiraffe: The husband's response about how the family should have learned by now may be carrying too much weight in my mind.,False
inquisitiveCamel: sounds like he let his resentment build up.,False
openZebra: I don't she is the asshole. But I can see him getting frustrated if it's a constant thing. Asking for help every day or multiple times a day.,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I agree, he just can't assume the family will earn english ",False
lightBison: I also agree that he shouldn't blame them for not learning english,False
novelOtter: Does his being in the wrong impact what she is doing?,False
eagerBear: I think I would be honored if my in-laws felt comfortable having me translate things for them though.,False
inquisitiveCamel: learn*,False
openZebra: it's also a little late for them to fully learn english at this stage in life.,False
"inspiredGiraffe: I think there is plenty of blame to go around.  The writer shouldn't have assumed he should do it all.  The husband should be willing to do more, and the mother / mother-in-law might be a bit ungrateful.",False
"inquisitiveCamel: Yes, and it's a way for him to bond with her family. Why does he not appreciate that?",False
"eagerBear: I agree. Although, the husband could offer to teach them some English during their translation sessions, if he's so adamant about it",False
inquisitiveCamel: v true,False
lightBison: so is she an asshole?,False
eagerBear: I definitely don't think she's an asshole,False
openZebra: I don't either,False
inquisitiveCamel: me either,False
"inspiredGiraffe: So I guess I'm saying he's more than 51% of the asshole, which by these rules means she isn't.",False
openZebra: i don't think he's the asshole either,False
openZebra: sure lol,False
novelOtter: So they both cant be assholes?,False
eagerBear: The question was if SHE was an asshole. ,False
"eagerBear: She's not really, she probably didn't know he was upset before he said something",False
"inspiredGiraffe: Well, being literal it asks if a person is THE asshole, not AN asshole.",False
"novelOtter: I think the way she phrased the question at the end, using the word making him translate, makes her one",False
"inspiredGiraffe: I'm going to say no, she is not.",False
openZebra: i'm going to say no as well,False
openGorilla: Absolutely he is.,False
curiousBear: Oh he's an asshole,False
inspiredDolphin: I agree. Total asshole,False
"delightedCamel: He is, even after the edit where he walks back the langauge.",False
inspiredDolphin: She doesn't have to learn English if she doesn't want.,False
"curiousBear: oh yeah, his whole personality just shines through real ugly in that post",False
inspiredDolphin: I think even he knows he's an asshole,False
curiousBear: lol,False
novelHorse: i think he can be frustrated from being called all the time but the language he uses to explain makes him a complete asshole to her,False
openGorilla: The fact that she did not use him as her primary translator and only used him if she could not get ahold of other family members was a big thing for me. He could just not answer the phone. ,False
inspiredDolphin: He could have just told his mother in law he wasn't comfortable translating all of the time',False
"delightedCamel: Good point, openGorilla",False
curiousBear: I agree that it's understandable to be frustrated by constant interruption,False
curiousBear: If he's so annoyed why doesn't he just pay for a translator for her,False
novelHorse: that probably wouldn't look good on him either,False
inspiredDolphin: Or offer to teach her himself,False
"fulfilledMonkey: I was on the fence a bit, until i re read the prompt....",False
"curiousBear: it wouldnt be a good look, true, bue a proactive solution, yes!",False
inspiredDolphin: He sounds very bitter. And extremely privileged and cocky about his language knowledge. ,False
curiousBear: very true,False
fulfilledMonkey: at first i thought she was constantly call him to translate all the time. but he clearly said when she isn't able to get a hold of anyother family members,False
novelHorse: yes it's not easy for most people to learn a language in a year,False
"delightedCamel: Because he learned multiple languages at a young age, he vastly underestimates how hard it would be for his in-laws.  ",False
"inspiredDolphin: He knows he lives in a predominately Spanish area, he should assume many there wouldn't speak English well.",False
fulfilledMonkey: I do think it's not too much to pick up some key words or phrase to get by day to day,False
"curiousBear: Yeah, just because he learns languages easily (not so humble brag) doesn't mean it's easy for everyone",False
fulfilledMonkey: but you shouldn't expect some one to just fully learn a language especially the older they are.,False
"inspiredDolphin: She could and probably does know key phrases, but might be embarrassed to speak them.",False
fulfilledMonkey: true,False
"delightedCamel: It's easier to learn language as a child, and easier to learn a third than the second.  ",False
openGorilla: It seems like he let annoyance over occasional interruptions get under his skin too easily. Having your in-laws ask you for help occasionally is not a big deal.  ,False
curiousBear: It's part of the package if you ask me,False
delightedCamel: Is there any strong counter-point to be made?,False
inspiredDolphin: I agree with that,False
novelHorse: i agree,False
curiousBear: it's additional family you're taking on,False
inspiredDolphin: It's hard to find a counterpoint.,False
inspiredDolphin: I think he's an asshole,False
openGorilla: If he was the primary translator and it was happening daily there could be a defense. ,False
openGorilla: But that was not the case. ,False
fulfilledMonkey: the only counter point i can think of is if he is being called upon many many times a day for help ,False
curiousBear: my vote is still asshole,False
fulfilledMonkey: but i don't think that is the case.,False
"delightedCamel: I would only defend him by saying that his position did not make him racist as he was called, but definitely the asshole.",False
fulfilledMonkey: my vote is asshole,False
excitedGorilla: I personally think the guy is not the asshole since it's his choice to speak whatever language he wants.,False
novelDolphin: I don't think this person is the asshole. There isn't a way to keep both his mother and husband comfortable without compromise.,False
"fulfilledZebra: Hello, I think this guy should have respected his mother more and spoke English and German, taking the time for both people to understand what the conversation, especially in his mother's house!",False
"brightHorse: well my initial impression is that he is an asshole, since the mother is hosting them, feeding them, etc. and they can't even include her in their conversations",False
"inquisitiveHippo: Basically living for free on mother's dime, should be considerate of requests.",False
"brightHorse: they are only visiting her for the weekend, they don't see each other all of the time, and the husband knows how to speak English (even if he isn't completely comfortable with it)",False
"excitedGorilla: I don't think they weren't including her in their conversations. I feel like the mother was more just like ""I can't understand German, so don't use it/""",False
brightHorse: both the poster and his husband should have some more respect for the mother,False
"fulfilledZebra: I agree with brightHorse and even if it wasn't in her house, the son should have the courtesy to include his mother in conversations. ",False
"inquisitiveHippo: Ideally, she should encourage husband to speak more english otherwise he won't get better, and mother could help too. ",False
brightHorse: she even says that she feels like she is not being included,False
novelDolphin: He should have spoken English if his husband can understand it.,False
brightHorse: if they could all carry a conversation on in english and choose not to then it's pretty rude to the mother,False
excitedGorilla: I'm in a similar situation as I'm Russian and my husband is American. Trust me when I say the mother is the one being stubborn,False
"fulfilledZebra: The trip was so short, and unless they were learning English in Germany, it would be way easier for the son to speak both languages - he is the asshole",False
brightHorse: how is she being stubborn when she does not understand the other lanuage that they speak,False
"brightHorse: it's just a weekend visit and they don't see each other all of the time, it's the least they could do to accomodate the mother who is graciously housing and feeding them",False
"excitedGorilla: It's not like they are exclusively speaking German. Most likely when they talk to each other, they speak in German, but the mother wants to hear everything they are saying to each other",False
novelDolphin: I do think he should have included his mother but he  shouldn't feel bad for making his spouse feel comfortable.,False
"inquisitiveHippo: Yeah, it shouldn't be a big deal to them and it means a lot to the mom.",False
"fulfilledZebra: I can understand the son wanting his husband to be comfortable in his mother's house, but he should afford the same comfort to his mother as well",False
"excitedGorilla: If it's three-way conversation, they are most likely speaking English.",False
"brightHorse: he is saying that he is spending the majority of the time speaking in german, which means that he is not spending the majority of the time speaking to his mother who he doesn't see often",False
"excitedGorilla: ""So we almost always speak German to each other.""",False
excitedGorilla: they don't speak it to the mom,False
"brightHorse: ""I chose the latter, but this means that over the weekend I've talked mostly in German.""",False
excitedGorilla: just to each other,False
brightHorse: of course they don't speak it to the mom,False
"brightHorse: but they are having conversations in german in front of the mom, not including her",False
brightHorse: when they could include her and just speak english,False
"inquisitiveHippo: its being exclusionary and for the limited time they ahve to deal with speaking english, its a small concession to make. ",False
"fulfilledZebra: I think if the son could do the situation over, he would include his mother more and speak to both of them in their native tongues as well as translating between them.",False
"excitedGorilla: If it doesn't involve her, then there is no issue",False
novelDolphin: That's true. They could have just dealt with it since it was such a short time.,False
brightHorse: it's literally just a weekend,False
brightHorse: there is an issue since she is not being included,False
inquisitiveHippo: Its not like anyone gets excluded if they speak english whereas someone is entirely excluded. Small inconvenience for inclusion.,False
excitedGorilla: Being included is not the same as speaking in English. What you're saying is that she just wants to eavesdrop,False
"lightHorse: I think this one is close, but from the information we have, I'm slightly leaning towards Asshole.",False
lightHorse: I think the mother overlooks her son-in-laws self-consciousness towards ESL,False
eagerZebra: Slightly leaning towards asshole as well now. Expecting the partner to speak language that they are clearly uncomfortable with.,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I'm thinking not an asshole on this. She may have been awkward, but she did express her feelings about her being uncomfortable.",False
"lightHorse: It may be disrespectful somewhat in the mother's eyes, but I think there is more going on that the mother doesn't understand",False
"delightedBear: my initial impression is that the poster is not the asshole, since they are allowing the son and partner to stay at their house and the partner knows how to speak english, even if he has an accent",False
"lightHorse: I'm technically an ESL speaker, and it's very uncomfortable at first",False
delightedBear: i understand it may be uncomfortable for the partner but it's also uncomfortable for the poster to be excluded,False
lightHorse: I think the mother is overlooking this fact,False
"eagerZebra: There definately may be more to the situation than we know and they don't live there on a normal basis. So it may be less enjoyable with language barrier, but more comfortable for the partner who has the difficulty.",False
eagerZebra: Definately seems a little small-minded on the mother's part.,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I would feel more uncomfortable being left out than struggling to speak a language.,False
delightedBear: i think the poster could have gone about it in a better way maybe but i don't think they're being an asshole,False
inspiredBison: I think the man's husband was being overly sensitive and irrational,False
"lightHorse: If anything, I think all the language responsibility should be on the son",False
"lightHorse: If the son-in-law wants to speak his native tongue, let him",False
inquisitiveGorilla: The mother is being insensitive but the husband should still respect the host.,False
"delightedBear: it would only be respectful to speak in the language that everyone there knows, so that everyone could be involved. if they want to have a private conversation they could go to their room.",False
inspiredBison: I think the mother has the right in her own home to be included in conversations in English ,False
"lightHorse: But be honest, it wasn't the son-in-laws idea to go visit the mother",False
delightedBear: the partner should be respectful to the poster who is letting him stay in her house,False
inspiredBison: I do not understand the son and French partner excluding the mother when they bother know English,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I agree with lightHorse it should be on the son to figure a compromise.,False
"lightHorse: So that means he was probably dragged to a place he didn't want to go, and then forced to speak a language he didn't want to",False
inspiredBison: I think the son and his partner are assholes and not the mother,False
delightedBear: you're assuming things that were not stated,False
eagerZebra: They are definately visiting so its not a permanant situation. With time they may also become more confortable since its also probably stressful living with an in-law.,False
eagerZebra: It may not only be an ESL issue but one of just being nervous.,False
"delightedBear: it's just a visit, the least they could do it accomodate the person letting them stay there",False
lightHorse: I hated speaking English around English speakers when I first started. The fact that they even bring up my accent is degrading to my English skills.,False
"inspiredBison: The mother opened her home to them and deserves some respect and consideration from her son and his partner, and that starts with conversation in a language she understands",False
"excitedOtter: So, coming from a mexican-american household as a first generation American, I don't find this person to be the asshole",False
openGorilla: This person is absolutely the asshole. How could you talk in that language to your stepmom? I actually agree with the idea that she should learn English but there is a way to say it.,False
"openGorilla: Not stepmom, mother in law*",False
openGorilla: sorry about that,False
excitedOtter: English and Spanish were my first language and I learned French on my own time so,False
excitedOtter: It's absolutley doable,False
fulfilledGiraffe: Living here for 8 years is more than enough time to learn the language to some point,False
openGorilla: I learned Spanish on my own as well,False
"fulfilledGiraffe: He said he didn't talk that way to her, he was polite and offered to help her learn",False
"curiousCamel: I understand frustration with being asked to translate, but there are better ways to convey that feeling",False
excitedOtter: Shouldn't have to rely on somebody to translate for you 24/7 for free too lol,False
brightZebra: I think hes definnetly an asshole if he did in fact use that language to his step mom,False
"openGorilla: But you should not speak in that tone to your mother in law. His reasoning was correct, his approach was wrong.",False
excitedOtter: Well in the edit it said he used better languge,False
excitedOtter: I think the languge he used in the post just shows his furstration to uis,False
fulfilledGiraffe: Did anyone read the edit at the bottom of the post?  ,False
brightZebra: true he did say that but that was correction when he was getting flak from the comments,False
"curiousCamel: If's he's done with the favor, he should have his wife lay down the law with the mother in law",False
excitedOtter: True there was a better way to do it too,False
fulfilledGiraffe: I think it is unreasonable to expect him to always be available at the drop of a hat,False
"openGorilla: I agreed with everything he said, I just did not agree with how he said it.",False
excitedOtter: But still being used like that constantly would whenever needed is unreasonable,False
"curiousCamel: It's the mother in law's choice not to learn English, so she should be responsible for getting a translator herself",False
"excitedOtter: or like, use google translate or something",False
"fulfilledGiraffe: If he told her in a rude way then he was the asshole, but if he was polite, then I don't think he is the asshole",False
openGorilla: The mother in law really has no leg to stand on. She should not be interrupting him all the time and she should learn the language. It is a lack of effort from her.,False
brightZebra: True it is unfair to assume that he would always be available to help.,False
"curiousCamel: You can't expect everyone to be able to pick up a new language, but it's fair to not want to be a crutch",False
"openGorilla: Yeah, I think we are all in agreement pretty much.",False
excitedOtter: Yes but we have to consider that she's bee here for 8 years already,False
"fulfilledGiraffe: she doesn't need to become fluent, just enough to get by",False
"openGorilla: But then again, if she goes and learns English based on his conversation with her, then it works out for everyone.",False
fulfilledGiraffe: she would be more independent if she learned,False
curiousCamel: She could humble herself to ask for help in person with communication rather than hassling her son in law,False
curiousCamel: There's a tradeoff for not assimilating.,False
fulfilledGiraffe: I think he is in the right here,False
excitedOtter: And I do think it's kind of sad how his wife's family turned on hi,False
excitedOtter: He's not the asshole here to me,False
brightZebra: I don't think he is an asshole,False
excitedOtter: You have to expand   to vote,False
excitedOtter: the blue expand button up above the chat,False
openGorilla: I said he was,False
openGorilla: Just because of his language and tone,False
openGorilla: But I see everyones point,False
inquisitiveZebra: This is a tough one but I do think the woman could be a bit more understanding of her husband.,False
"inspiredHippo: While I understand the wish to take care of her parents, she is actually crippling them by not helping the learn English",False

"inquisitiveZebra: Yes, I agree.",False
inquisitiveZebra: She needs to help her parents learn the language.,False
"excitedBison: I understand that the family has worked hard to be in America and is tired, but so is the husband!",False
curiousHorse: True she needs to help her mother learn firstly,False
"openGiraffe: So I do believe that she is the asshole in this one. She needs to understand how her husband feels and can't be so expectant of her husband. Although she may think her husband has ""free time"", how does she know what her husband is doing?",False
"inquisitiveZebra: If she can go and get her MBA, she can take 30 minutes out of the day to set her parents up with Duolingo or something that will help them",False
"inspiredHippo: I do think the husband could be more helpful though, it doesn't sound like it is all the time he has to help",False
curiousHorse: It's a bandaid to ask the husband for help constanly,False
excitedBison: I agree that this is the wife's problem. Her husband didn't sign up to be a translator.,False
"openGiraffe: This feels like when my mom tells me that I don't do anything all day while I'm in my room, but the truth is that I'm working on my college assignments most of the time",False

"openGiraffe: And wants me to do things for her because ""I'm not doing anything else""",False
inquisitiveZebra: She is the asshole in this situation. She comes off as selfish and entitled.,False
curiousHorse: I agree it's very selfish to assume he is always able to help her mother.,False

inquisitiveZebra: I respect the husband for saying something.,False
excitedBison: The husband seems to have done a lot already in terms of helping the family assimilate.,False
inspiredHippo: I agree the husband had don a lot already for the family,False
"inspiredHippo: It is nice that she wants to help her parents, but in this case she is being the asshole by not considering her husband's side of things.",False

eagerOtter: I agree completely. Is there a nice way to really say what he said?,False
"fulfilledZebra: I think the man isn't a bad guy, considering the fact that he said"" i want you to be independent and be able to do what you need to do without one of us as a translator in a really polite and respectful tone""",False
inspiredBison: However he claims to have stated it in a nice way. ,False
brightMonkey: He should have considered her ability and possible insecurity.,False
"fulfilledZebra: And he said ""Im a white guy and a self taught spanish speaker.""",False
inspiredBison: I think he should have expressed his frustration to his wife and asked to not be a contact person for translating if he's unhappy with it.,False
brightMonkey: I feel he was definitely wrong in his approach. All agree?,False
curiousBear: Yes,False
fulfilledZebra: No,False
eagerOtter: Yes,False
"delightedHorse: It might be frustrating to be interrupted several times during the day to assist. Maybe he should offer to teach her in his spare time., ",False
brightMonkey: Or no. Why?,False
inspiredBison: We can't control other's abilities or actions and it's rude to state these things to in-laws directly,False
eagerOtter: I agree that he could have taught her as well.,False
inspiredBison: I agree he was wrong in his approach. Great points all around,False
"curiousBear: I also agree. Even though he did give her many resources, it would be better for him to teach her personally.",False
brightMonkey: Have we come to a consenus that he was in the wrong and definitely an Ahole in his reaction?,False
brightMonkey: He has a life. But rudeness has no place.,False
inspiredBison: brightMonkey I say yes and technically yes b/c he was an asshole in his tone and not considerate of his mother in law,False

livelyCamel: What other options does the daughter have to help her parents?,False
"excitedMonkey: But since it's the mother in law, I think the husband could spend some time teaching her.",False
brightHippo: If a famiily member (older) called and asked  you to help clear out the garage one week and the next to help paint a room or fix some plumbing   is it wrong?,False
inquisitiveZebra: I think it irrational for the women to be asking the man to do things,False
inquisitiveZebra: But the man has the right to be annoyed by her request because it became a constant request from the women,False
brightHippo: Comes down to if the marriage is all it could be.  It is a small thing to ask to help ,False
excitedMonkey: Would it be more rational if it was a man asking another man to do things?,False
novelBear: I think the daughter should be trying to help her mother. It is HER mother after all. That way the husband could be relieved.,False
"livelyCamel: brightHippo I don't think so. However, if someone asked you to help every week for multiple days then I consider that asking too much.",False
livelyCamel: novelBear I agree. She could take on some of the burden and also get lessons for her parents,False

eagerHorse: I believe this person is being very rude to his mother',False
"inspiredBear: I think he's slightly the asshole. The mother should probably not be so reliant on him, but I doubt that he nicely told her to learn Enlish.",False
inspiredBear: English.,False
"curiousCamel: He was more concerned with how it annoyed him, rather than how learning English would help her out",False
delightedBison: I think he should have talked to his spouse about this and see what she would have thought,False
lightElephant: I think it was okay to tell her he is frustrated because he is trying to help her ,False
"inquisitiveHippo: I think he could have offered to help her with conversational phrases, such as how to ask for things in restaurants. ",False

excitedGiraffe: He was rude yes. but she's been in country for 8 YEARS. come on,False
curiousCamel: There are many other ways he could have gone about it but he does seem pretty aggressive and demandling in his language choice.,False
inquisitiveHippo: Just having the attitude of I learned Spanish you can learn English is very arrogant. ,False
delightedBison: I think he should have offerred to help her learn.,False

"inquisitiveHippo: Yes, a lot of older folks don't have smart phones. ",False
eagerHorse: Some imigrants came to the USA from a very poor background and barely finish elementary school,False
"curiousCamel: Saying that he hates her calling for help shows that his intent for her learnign English isn't about her own good or general indepedence, but rather he wants  her to learn English for his own benefits.",False

inspiredMonkey: This one was tough because I think they are both being assholes. ,False

"inspiredMonkey: you think would, but you'd find it tough. period. ",False
"delightedElephant: I would also learn a language of a country I was moving to, but the United States doesn't have an official language so it's not the same comparison.",False

fulfilledOtter: Yes,False

"novelElephant: I'm torn and could go either way, tbh,",False
"curiousHorse: Yes, if it's every once in a while, I think it's okay to translate for the parents. However, they are her parents, not his. She is more obligated to them than he is.",False
"novelElephant: I mean, nobody studies 100% of the time",False
fulfilledOtter: My mom is always willing to help my grandmother with translations because its quick and easy for her,False
"eagerDolphin: I think she pushed it off on her husband, is really that busy?",False
"fulfilledOtter: If it wasn't my language, it wouldn't be as quick to translate.",False
curiousHorse: I agree about pushing it to her husband.,False
"novelElephant: If it's often enough that it actually interferes with her studies, then it's probably too often for the husband to be doing it since it is her parents",False
eagerDolphin: And how often do they never translation? It might be annoying.,False
inspiredZebra: Yes husband is right her parents should have learned the language but she is not responsible for what her parent did or didn't do,False
novelElephant: I can agree that she is the asshole,False
eagerDolphin: I don’t think the husband is an asshole,False
"inquisitiveMonkey: i guess she is the asshole, considering its her family and he is uncomfrotable with it",False

novelElephant: yeah that's true,False
inspiredZebra: yes I did ,False
"curiousHorse: Yes, I agree.",False
fulfilledOtter: Yes I agree too.,False

inspiredZebra: yes I agree as well,False
novelElephant: So the poster is the asshole ,False
inquisitiveMonkey: yes,False
"curiousHorse: Yes, my vote is she's the asshole.",False

inspiredZebra: Only because there is no grey area,False
curiousHorse: Yes.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: yes,False
inspiredZebra: Well I think she could translate for her parents when and if she has the time,False
inspiredZebra: This person is the asshole,False
novelElephant: Yep ,False
"curiousBear: not the asshole, its not rude to ask someone to learn the language when they count on you for everything. if he approached it nicely, then i think its okay and hes not the asshole",False
"livelyBison: Even though this person comes off really abrasive and harsh, I think he's just blowing off steam in the post, but was actually polite to his in-laws",False
livelyBison: so not the asshole,False
livelyBison: I wouldn't want my in-laws calling several times a day about ANYTHING much less something that's basically work,False
"excitedZebra: This one is kind of hard to be honest. In some ways, he's an asshole. In another way, I see his point. Just not sure it should come from him.",False
eagerCamel: He's the asshole.,False
livelyBison: Would you want to help your in-laws with something mentally taxing several times a day?,False
eagerCamel: He said she calls only when she can't get a hold of other family members. This is also avoiding her educational level.,False
curiousBear: being needed for constant translation for someone that wont learn a bit of english to get by is hard. he offered many ways to help her learn english,False
eagerCamel: He said sometimes.,False
eagerCamel: He didn't say constantly.,False
"curiousBear: true, i shouldnt have used constantly",False
excitedZebra: He was polite to his inlaws about it. I just wonder if the message should have come from his wife first though.,False
novelGorilla: I don't believe the poster is the AH because he didn't say it rudely when he said that to his mother in law. I believe some people just get used to having someone else do the translating for them. She should try to be indeoendent,False
"livelyBison: I guess he said ""random times"" ",False
livelyBison: still,False
livelyBison: that would be annoying,False
novelGorilla: Yes. What if he is at work?,False
eagerCamel: He wasn't polite. Reminding someone how long they've been here to justify criticizing their lack of language skills isn't nice,False
"eagerCamel: Again, he said she calls him sometimes when she can't reach any other family first. He's a last resort call",False
novelGorilla: That could be really annoying and would cut in to his schedule,False
eagerCamel: How often would that be happening?,False
excitedZebra: I agree it would be annoying though.,False
"curiousBear: i understand why someone would get offended by being asked to learn english. but if you depend on other people to get things done, its not that crazy to be asked to learn some english",False
"excitedZebra: But if he wasn't around, what would she do then?",False
curiousBear: i dont think he is an asshole,False
livelyBison: I think he probably just said about how long she's been here since it would be different if she JUST moved here,False
novelGorilla: But he even offered to help her on the way,False
livelyBison: whereas at this point it looks like she's just too lazy to try,False
"eagerCamel: Again, we don't know her educational level. She may not even be able to read duolingo",False
livelyBison: and so just relies on others all the time,False
novelGorilla: True,False
eagerCamel: I live in California. It's not laziness. There are a lot of people who speak Spanish in professional settings.,False
"curiousBear: he offered to help her find ways to learn, he is stressed out from having to help. i believe he is not the asshole",False
"excitedZebra: Yes, he did offer to help. So he's not an asshole in my book. It would be one thing to say that she should learn English and left it at that. But he didn't.",False
eagerCamel: He's the asshole.,False
"novelGorilla: No, I don't think so",False
"eagerCamel: If I get a call from my in laws sometimes to help them, I'm not going to get upset and demand they learn.",False
curiousBear: it is obvoiusly not sometimes that hes being called,False
livelyBison: I just can't imagine feeling like you have to be available to help translate at any moment,False
"eagerCamel: It's like with computers and the ederly. My father calls all the time, I'm not going to tell him to go take a class.",False
"novelGorilla: Well, what if it is everyday?",False
"livelyBison: But it's your father, not your in-law",False
eagerCamel: How is it obvious it isn't sometimes?,False
curiousBear: were going to have a hung jury,False
eagerCamel: My mother in law also calls me,False
curiousBear: i believe he is not the ashole,False
"excitedZebra: No, but the frequency would get annoying. I still don't think he's an asshole.",False
"livelyBison: He could have been way meaner about, so I don't think he's the asshole",False
"eagerCamel: Again, how are you all so sure of the frequency?",False
novelGorilla: I don't either,False
curiousBear: he has his reasons to get stressed out and went about it in a fair way,False
novelGorilla: We aren't sure,False
"livelyBison: he says ""at random times of the day"" and his frustration level makes me think it isn't like once a month",False
eagerCamel: My wife's mom sometimes calls me when she can't get ahold of other family members asking me to translate ,False
eagerCamel: That's what he said,False
"excitedZebra: No one is sure, but over time, it could get on your nerves.",False
novelGorilla: Just might be on his time,False
eagerCamel: Then why isn't he annoyed talking to them in Spanish if he has to generally speak it around them?,False
curiousBear: he is not the asshole because he is stressed out and asked them to learn english. he didnt handle it badly. he,False
novelGorilla: If I was at work wouldn't want to be called,False
novelGorilla: Even if it is ocassionaly,False
livelyBison: I think it's the extra translation work he is being asked to do whenever needed,False
livelyBison: I still say not the asshole,False
novelGorilla: He isn't the asshole,False
eagerCamel: I think you are relating the two posts,False
novelGorilla: cuz he even offered to hep,False
novelGorilla: help,False
"eagerCamel: He didn't say he was stressed, that he was frustrated and it was annoying",False
openCamel: I think this is a tougher one. OP probably genuinely feels left out of conversation. Her son and partner are probably used to communicating in French and didn't think about it. ,False
openCamel: I think their reaction is more assholish than OPs though. ,False
inspiredZebra: I think this person is an asshole. There is nothing wrong with communicating in your language.,False
fulfilledBear: They are living in her home. If they want to have a private conversation they should go in a separate room. It’s disrespectful for them to not consider her. If it wasn’t a big deal they could have finished it in English ,False
"curiousElephant: I have been in similar situations. I know that I do not like it when people who know another language and English, choose to speak the one that they know I do not understand.",False
"inspiredZebra: I guarantee if any of you were in a different country around an english speaker, you would choose to use english.",False
"curiousElephant: It feels like you are being excluded and if you feel badly, it is okay to speak up and let people know. I do not think this woman was being an asshole.",False
lightDolphin: I think this person is an asshole because they are expecting to be a part of every conversation. The two are used to speaking in French.,False
openCamel: I think because they are a guest of her home they should be more cognizant of speaking so she can understand. ,False
inspiredZebra: It is her son who has come to visit with his partner. He is speaking to his partner.,False
"curiousElephant: In similar situations, I always speak the tongue of the host. It is rude to exclude people.",False
"openCamel: Right, but in the same room as her. ",False
lightDolphin: I don't think their reaction was appropriate either. I think they should have talked about it with each other.,False
inspiredZebra: Why is it necessary that she understand? Even if the conversation does not include her?,False
fulfilledBear: Most people woodland feel,False
openCamel: left out,False
"openCamel: Also, presumably her son and her usually speak English together. ",False
"curiousElephant: If you can make people feel included, you should do so, anything else is rude, especially given she opened her home to accommodate them both.",False
fulfilledBear: Like they are talking about us in that situation ,False
openCamel: Agree with curiousElephant,False
fulfilledBear: Agree,False
"inspiredZebra: I don't think so. I assume when he is conversing with all of them, he speaks english.",False
openCamel: He was with all of them,False
"inspiredZebra: Yeah, but he and his boyfriend were speaking.",False
"curiousElephant: This woman is not an asshole, no.",False
openCamel: I agree with that. ,False
inspiredZebra: There's no reason why someone should be forced to make someone else feel comfortable. She understood that he was a french man who's first language is french. He was not rude.,False
fulfilledBear: They were not being considerate of all parties . Mom is not the asshole. Boyfriend was the asshole for leaving the room. ,False
lightDolphin: I can agree with that.,False
excitedZebra: I think that the husband should be trying harder to get to know the mother ,False
"inquisitiveOtter: I think OP is the AH, but very slightly. He could have let his mom know that his partner is shy about his english speaking and that is why they prefer to use German together.",False
"curiousHorse: I think that he was being unfair to his mom. She rarely gets to see him. Although I understand he son's husband is not comfortable with is English, it's not an excuse to make his mother feel so badly.",False
inquisitiveOtter: I agree curiousHorse,False
"openHippo: I also feel like the mother is being dramatic, she is not incapable of 'catching-up' with her son. He can still speak english.",False
lightCamel: This one was a bit difficult but I don't think the son was an asshole. The son and mother should try to understand each other's views and not put the son in the middle.,False
curiousHorse: at the very least he could have done a 50 50 split of German and English and TRANSLATED for his pained mom so she felt included. That is what I would have done. ,False
lightCamel: I agree with openHippo,False
excitedZebra: Agree ,False
"openHippo: I agree, that he could have at least translated, but I don't think he is in the complete wrong for just speaking german with his uncomfortable partner.",False
curiousHorse: I think her son could have handled that a lot better. ,False
excitedZebra: The son didn’t try to forge a bridge ,False
inquisitiveOtter: Yes excitedZebra,False
inquisitiveOtter: Son could have handled it better for sure. ,False
lightCamel: That's fair.,False
curiousHorse: Everyone could have given a little. Her son could have spoke english 50% of the time and german 50%. this would also help his husband learn to be more comfortable.,False
curiousHorse: the husband should have tried speaking english too sometimes.,False
inquisitiveOtter: And maybe mom would learn some German. ,False
curiousHorse: yeah and mom could learn some german too. it could have been a lot more inclusive for all if everyone gave a little,False
inquisitiveOtter: I think being shy about speaking a 2nd language coupled with probably being nervous to be at your in-laws house deepens this issue a bit. ,False
curiousHorse: instead the son didn;t care as much about his mom's feelings as he did his husbands. sad.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: I think OP is probably trying to help his husband through his language insecurities and make him feel comfortable, but then caused this problem. ",False
"openHippo: As someone who speaks a second language, sometimes I also just revert to english because it's easier to get my point across. so i can understand that sentiment.",False
curiousHorse: they all could have done better for each other and learned something,False
openHippo: Yeah,False
curiousHorse: instead the son just decided his mom's feelings were not as important.,False
lightCamel: I think everyone is a bit of an asshole here pretty equally.,False
inquisitiveOtter: On reddit i think it might be an ESH- everybody sucks here. ,False
"curiousHorse: I think the son was an asshole, but they all could have done better.",False
openHippo: I don't think it was completely assholish.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Not completely, but also not totally innocent either. ",False
"lightCamel: The mom and SIL could have each made more of an effort to communicate, and the son could have done better connecting the two to make them both feel more comfrotable.",False
curiousHorse: yeah I agree with light lightCamel ,False
openHippo: I think the mother was completely still capable of bonding with her son at the end of the day.,False
inquisitiveOtter: Right. I think someone mentioned building bridges. ,False
"brightBison: I believe the person is an asshole. While he says he talked to the mother-in-law in a kind and respectful manner, his language/defensive language in his Reddit post leads me to believe he may not be as cordial as he lets on.",False
"fulfilledHorse: I think he's kind of the asshole.  Older people have a harder time learning new languages, for one thing. It doesn't sound like she's calling every 5 minutes or anything, just when she needs help. ",False
delightedElephant: This person is definitely the asshole. I have a situation very similar to this story my Mil  is from Mexico and has been here for 29 years and still speaks very broken English. The way he went about it was very white privilege speaking. ,False
"fulfilledHorse: I agree with brightBison -- he sounds like his not being very helpful about it. Surely coming at it from a ""let's learn together!"" would be nicer and better received.",False
fulfilledHorse: Also if that's his only issue with his inlaws he is lucky indeed. Just translate for her.,False
"brightBison: Helperbot is suggesting to view both sides. From this person's perspective, he's not an asshole for wanting the mother-in-law to learn English, but he could've gone about it in a more tactful manner.",False
"fulfilledHorse: I know that he's frustrated, and sure some days he might not feel like helping but...just set a few boundaries.  No calls before 10am maybe.",False
"delightedElephant: As for his side, he should consider being kind and helping in a way that isn’t perceived as white privilege.",False
"novelMonkey: i believe she is an asshole, despite their misunderstanding for 8 years and their decision to care for the two children in different weeks. she could at least give the gratitude  of making the 2 kids happy by attending the reunion  ",False
openCamel: He could have approached her in a different way. He was annoyed by her constant demands. He does seem kind of like the asshole. Although I feel the mother in law and rest of family are overreacting.,False
delightedElephant: My conclusion is that he is an asshole and he needs to be more understanding of her situation,False
fulfilledHorse: Ok it looks like we agree he's the asshole.  except for novelMonkey talking about the wrong scenario.,False
openCamel: I conclude he is the asshole and should be more sensitive to older peoples needs.,False
fulfilledHorse: he should find a better way to deal with the issue that isn't offensive,False
livelyBear: Hearing it from this side of the story makes me realize both of them are being unrealistic and their expectations for one another,False
livelyBear: I get it she just wants to help out her mom although it’s not her husband’s responsibility to make sure she’s OK in the sense of translation,False
"openGiraffe: Hey it's the other side of a previous scenario. She's not completely an asshole, it's ok to expect some help from husband. But she shouldn't throw it all on him.",False
"inquisitiveBison: I feel like the person is a bit too entitled to her husband's free time. Yes, it would be nice if he helps out, but he has a life too, even though she claims she's busier.",False
"livelyBear: I am Magine recurring translations can be frustrating, And it would be helpful if the mother learn the basics in English since she’s living in a primarily English-speaking area",False
fulfilledElephant: She should have asked her husband if it was ok for him to translate. Regardless she is not the asshole ,False
openGiraffe: They should both be helping her mom.,False
"openGiraffe: She shouldn't expect him to do it single-handedly, but he should help.  Again I think boundaries are the answer; he should set times he's available, or help mom learn the language actively.",False
lightZebra: she should equally help her mother to solve the translation not pushing to her husband always. or better still pay for a class for the mother  ,False
inquisitiveBison: She says her parents have been trying to make it in the USA their whole lives. I don't think it's unreasonable for the husband to expect them to learn English in such a long amount of time.,False
lightZebra: the man is not an asshole ,False
fulfilledElephant: They both need a better system for mom. She just assumed stepping up for family was what everyone did. ,False
openGiraffe: Right fulfilledElephant -- they should be working together to fix this problem instead of asking strangers on the internet who the bigger asshole is.,False
"inquisitiveBison: Conclusion: I agree with fulfilledElephant I'll call her an asshole for the sake of this task in the sense she isn't respecting her husband's boundaries, but they could stand to have a better system than the arguments they go through now.",False
lightZebra: the wife is the asshole ,False
openGiraffe: So wife is the bigger asshole but still both assholes lol,False
fulfilledElephant: I conclude the wife is the asshole,False
openHippo: my impression is that the husband is the real asshole in the story,False
delightedDolphin: I think her husband shouldn't complain about translating for her parents. I don't think she is being an asshole at all. I think that he should help since he is a part of her family now. ,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Hey everyone!  What are your opinions?  I'm not so sure who's really the asshole here.  She doesn't seem to be too unreasonable, but I can see how he'd be upset.",False
openHippo: he is not supportive and is approaching the matter wrongly,False
"delightedDolphin: I think that when you marry someone you have to sacrifice time and help them when they need it. Spouses are supposed to help one another, I believe.",False
fulfilledMonkey: I feel the partner is,False
eagerZebra: The partner is an asshole IMO,False
delightedDolphin: So we all agree- the partner is the asshole,False
fulfilledMonkey: yeah,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Cool, I think we're all in agreement then.  :)",False
eagerZebra: Yes,False
openHippo: i feel the should  should talked the wife in more respectful manner and tell her why he unconformable with the issue ,False
fulfilledMonkey: Exactly my view,False
openHippo: yeah the partner is the asshole,False
"delightedDolphin: It is hard to learn another language at an older age. He didn't seem to be taking that into consideration either when he said ""they should just learn themselves""",False
inquisitiveOtter: True,False
eagerZebra: I agfree with that,False

openHippo: if he is uncomfortable he could hire a translator to do the job,False
"inquisitiveOtter: LOL, good idea!",False
"openBear: Once I read the edit at the end, I didn't think he was an asshole any more. ",False
excitedHorse: I think that he is being an asshole. I think that he shouldn't be upset to help someone that needs help- especially if it's his family! ,False
"openBear: At the beginning, I thought it was really disrespectful ... but then it felt more like him trying to help at the end.",False
eagerGiraffe: the husband is a total asshole,False
delightedZebra: I dont think he is an asshole,False
excitedHorse: I think that he isn't taking into consideration that it's hard to learn a new language at an older age. It isn't that hard for him to sacrifice a little time to help someone who needs help.,False
novelCamel: He is not an asshole,False
excitedHorse: Maybe he wasn't because he said it in a nice polite tone at the end. He wasn't being an asshole. But he could've been nicer I feel,False
novelCamel: he is after the woman's indepedence,False
excitedHorse: What do you guys think,False
openBear: trying to help someone gain independence it pretty cool - especially if he really offered to help along the way.,False
novelCamel: He is nit,False
excitedHorse: yeah thats true he did want her to be independent ,False
delightedZebra: He is not,False
excitedHorse: okay so we all agree he is not an asshole right,False
excitedHorse: because he asked her in a polite way and wanted to help her be independent?,False
"openBear: I agree with you excitedHorse  Especially if it was truly coming from a good place.  It is hard to learn a new language, but it's an amazing skill to have.",False
excitedHorse: yes definitely!,False
eagerGiraffe: for making even such hurtful statements in the first place and comparing his learning ability to that of his wife .. some are fast learners others are not... she deserves all the time she needs to learn ..at least she is making efforts,False
"novelCamel: Yes, I did",False
excitedHorse: I did too ,False
eagerGiraffe: what do you think,False
delightedZebra: Both sides were considered,False
eagerGiraffe: partially he is an asshole,False
novelCamel: He is not an asshole,False
excitedHorse: yes partially but not fully,False

"brightGorilla: This is tough.. I think while it was reasonable for him to want to set a boundary with his MIL, this might not have been the best way. ",False
brightGorilla: He claims he sounded polite but just from his general tone in his post I’m worried it didn’t come across that way.,False
excitedBison: I agree. And it seems like his edit was related to being criticized about his intolerance.,False
"inspiredGiraffe: But at the same time, I don't think he's an asshole for wanting her to be self-sufficient.",False
openDolphin: I dont necessarily think hes an asshole because it really isnt his responsibility to take care of her and be her translator ,False
inspiredGiraffe: What if he can;t get to the phone and she stands there for half an hour waiting for somebody to help her?,False
"brightGorilla: I feel like it's fair to say ""I can't keep taking all this time to help"" but not to say ""you need to learn english""",False
"novelOtter: He could just stop transalting for her and that would be fine, but calling her out like that is an asshole move",False
excitedBison: I think that he should be encouraging her to learn English and get his wife to help with that.,False
openDolphin: I do understand that it might be frustrating getting called randomly in the middle of the day to help her ,False
openDolphin: but i do agree he doesnt need to call her out and make her feel incompetent ,False
"inspiredGiraffe: My exboyfriend's mom primarily speaks Spanish, and did in the household. She could very easily speak English in public and would get by on her own without any problems. But she spoke spanish when she could because she was comfy",False
"novelOtter: I think that if he does stop helping her translate, shell be more likely to learn than him calling her out.",False
excitedBison: He needs to be respectful to her while encouraging her to learn English if she wants to.,False
novelOtter: Is everyone in agreement that Yes hes an asshole?,False
excitedBison: He also needs to feel comfortable telling her that he can't help her if he's busy with something else.,False
"inspiredGiraffe: I don't thin he was really ""calling her out"" - I think he was being honest that she can't always rely on him to translate everything when she's in need",False
delightedCamel: I agree. He wasn't really calling her out at all.,False
"novelOtter: maybe he wasn't necessarily calling her out, but its not his place to tell her to learn English.",False
delightedCamel: Just wants what's best for her and to help her along the way,False
"brightGorilla: Also, I feel like the proof might be in the reactions here, that suggestion from one person who has a rep for being tolerant/nice might seem truly helpful, vs. from someone with a rep for being harsh/intolerant it seems like an attack?",False
delightedCamel: He's not going to be there to translate for her forever. ,False
"inspiredGiraffe: I don't think he was an asshole. They way he initially wrote about it in the thread made him seem like one, but when you break it down to why he reached out to her like this",False
inspiredGiraffe: I think it came from a place of love and wanting her to be self-sufficient,False
"openDolphin: I also do think he should of talked to his wife about the whole situation, how it was making him feel and decide together to talk to her and encourage her to learn english ",False
"novelOtter: Yes his motives may have been good, but that doesnt make him not an asshole",False
excitedBison: I think his expression of his frustration is what makes him the asshole.,False

"excitedBison: If the whole family feels like he was wrong, he probably was not behaving in a compassionate way.",False
"brightGorilla: I think most of the scenarios here are going to be that where you can see both sides, but somewhere in the middle communication got a bit screwy.",False
"novelGiraffe: Honestly, she's not an asshole for being upset. ",False

"fulfilledOtter: On one side- If you aren’t willing to give up your free time, why are you giving up that of another person.  ",False
"novelGiraffe: I think the main focus point should be his response. He put up a cold wall and said ""I don't want to do it""",False
inspiredBison: I think she should listen to her husband and understand that he is annoyed in doing this,False
fulfilledOtter: Are we supposed to assume this is definitely the same couple as before? ,False
fulfilledOtter: Because that adds a whole other layer,False
"excitedCamel: Its not like she is asking him to put his whole life on hold, it is just for a few minutes ocassionaly ",False
"eagerDolphin: She sounds pretty reasonable to me. I get that he's annoyed, but he seems pretty hot-headed.",False
openHippo: I don't think the couple before are related,False
fulfilledOtter:  I think a lot of the animosity could have been avoided if she had asked her husband his feelings on helping from the beginning.  ,False
openHippo: Just similar circumstances I guess.,False
fulfilledOtter: I agree that people should try to help their family.. but we have no backstory here on the husband and inlaws are tough.    What if the husband grew up with more absent parents and doesn’t necessarily feel the same duty to care for hers.,False
"excitedCamel: Agreed, i understand its not an ideal situation but he should be willing to help her when needed ",False
"novelGiraffe: The husband could have provided alternative plans for them. Instead, he came across as hot-headed and self-centered",False
inspiredBison: But I also feel like he knew what he was getting when he married and he should help out her family because of that,False
inspiredBison: I think their best route would be to all have a discussion mother included and try to explain the annoyances and problems.,False
inspiredBison: I think I now dont know whether yes or no,False
eagerDolphin: Agreed.,False
"novelGiraffe: Like, he is not entirely unreasonable for not wanting to do this every time they call. Nobody is crazy about their in-laws lol. But he could have handled it so much better",False
"excitedCamel: Yes agreed, i think he could of come off better than just getting upset and telling them to learn english. Unfortunately, thats not as easy to do ",False
openHippo: I feel that she kind of selfish for her to ask him to constantly translate for her mom.,False
fulfilledOtter: The only thing that threw me off about the wife was the lack of acknowledgement for his time.,False
openHippo: But he knew what he was getting into when he married her. ,False
inspiredBison: novelGiraffe Yes but I dont think he handled wrongly he didnt even say anything to the mother,False
novelGiraffe: He could have worked it out with them in a much more civil manner - I think he jumped to a conclusion without working it out,False
"fulfilledOtter: Yeah, like saying that you",False
fulfilledOtter: you're* busy but your husband isn't... hmm maybe he's unemployed at the moment but not sure.,False
"eagerDolphin: I think that she was translating for her parents all her life, so she probably also knows how much of her husband's time she's asking for.",False
"fulfilledOtter: Right, but she didn't ask, she told haha",False
"openHippo: Yeah, hard without more context from the husband's point of view",False
excitedCamel: asshole,False
fulfilledOtter: Yeah I'm leaning that way... gonna meditate on it for a few.,False

"brightCamel: depends if his frustration leaked out, wish we had more info ",False
inquisitiveHippo: no he did not use language but he may have said it wrong,False
brightCamel: also his intention might have been lost in translation,False

livelyElephant: not an asshole,False
fulfilledOtter: he ain't really an asshole,False
brightCamel: yeah,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I think the expectation that he will always take the calls is an asshole thing.,False
inquisitiveGorilla: She knew she would be busy.  Couldn't she introduce them to translation software?,False
excitedBison: i think the poster is the asshole for expecting her husband to provide translations on call,False
curiousHorse: okay lets get this together now I don't think she is ,False
openBear: he is really an asshole complaining about the calls,False
eagerGiraffe: i dont think there is anything wrong with him helping out,False
eagerGiraffe: he is an asshole for complaining ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: But does he have to be the one always doing the helping?,False
eagerGiraffe: what are married partners for ,False
curiousHorse: this is about her she was writing,False
openBear: there is nothing wrong in giving out some minute of his time and he is married to her,False
inquisitiveGorilla: its the constant expectation of it.  she should have planned ahead,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: help her parents find alternatives, enable them",False
excitedBison: it gets frustrating after a bunch of times though and it sounds like they call him everytime,False
eagerGiraffe: i still dont see any thing wrong ,False
excitedBison: she doesn't say what he might be doing or what his work situation seem like,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: nothing wrong with them calling, something wrong with her expecting him to always field those calls",False
eagerGiraffe: but she does not have an alternative ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: he probably did understand the culture before he married in,False
openBear: it wasn't her fault the brides parent grew fond of him,False
curiousHorse: no she is not a asshole,False
eagerGiraffe: yes,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: still, she could have anticipated the conflict.  there are always alternatives.  or set limits with them",False
brightElephant: There is nothing wrong with them calling him.,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: no, but she expects him to always be on call for them",False
eagerGiraffe: if he was in her shoes ,False
brightElephant: true,False
eagerGiraffe: lets think both sides ,False
openBear: @curiousHorse: i concur,False
brightElephant: there was no limits,False

curiousHorse: not a asshole,False
openBear: she ain't an asshole,False
eagerGiraffe: not an asshole ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: still think she's a bit asshole,False
brightElephant: I concur,False
"delightedCamel: I think the delivery of the message was quite poor - disrespectful, stopping them during talking, etc.",False
delightedCamel: I think this person is indeed the asshole. ,False
excitedDolphin: This feels like an entitlement issue. They feel 'excluded' from someone else's conversation and need to butt in.,False
delightedCamel: Agree excitedDolphin,False
eagerGiraffe: I agree. It could be that the French person is not comfortable speaking much because of their accent and this mom just alienated her son's partner,False
"curiousElephant: The conversation was clearly not about or directed to this person, otherwise they would be speaking in a way she could understand. Her interjection was quite rude.",False
"excitedDolphin: Yeah, I agree. He might also be shy.",False
fulfilledBear: I think that's a fair assessment. ,False
delightedCamel: Sounds like we all agree.  Does anyone think this person IS NOT an asshole?,False
fulfilledBear: I think we've reached a consensus.,False
curiousElephant: Agreed.,False
"excitedDolphin: Yep, agreed.",False
"excitedOtter: I'm torn on this one, but leaning towards No.  On one hand the mother is being a good host.  On the other, he should make his husband feel comfortable...",False
"lightDolphin: This seems like a case where each side can be seen as the asshole so it is hard to decide. The mom wants to be included in her son's life, which is understandable",False
"brightElephant: I have to side with the son in this case. Sure his mother may feel slighted, but he is trying to make his SO feel comfortable and his mother should be respectful of her guests' comfort. If she wants to talk to her son, then she should ask.",False
"curiousHorse: After reviewing all sides, I think she should be more accommodating to her mom as she rarely sees her. ",False
"inquisitiveCamel: The poster's rationalization is a bit warped (""choose between including my mother in the conversation or making my husband comfortable""), but the result is understandable. I lean toward not the asshole.",False
"curiousHorse: If the German-speaking spouse if posing an ultimatum, then he's the asshole here, but it didn't seem the case.",False
"brightElephant: The husband is just shy about speaking a language that isn't their native tongue. It's understandable he might be nervous about saying the wrong thing, especially in front of his mother-in-law.",False
"curiousHorse: She should encourage her spouse to speak what English he does know, so that all can communicate. ",False
"lightDolphin: I don't think the son is an asshole for wanting to make his partner comfortable, neither is his mom's desire to catch up with her son. No one is the asshole here really, just in need of a conversation",False
"excitedOtter: If they split time between the US and Germany, then hopefully the situation gets better over time with more exposure to English for the husband.",False
inquisitiveCamel: Presumably his mother can still use his native language to communicate with him about his life; she need not feel slighted by them speaking German.,False
"brightElephant: Agree with you lightDolphin neither is the asshole, but there is a breakdown in communication happening. ",False
curiousHorse: I would say yes.,False
"curiousHorse: But I digress, because the consensus seems to be no,",False
"novelOtter: I think she has a right to ask her husband to help, however I don't believe she should always be asking him to help and stop and drop. ",False
openElephant: I agree with novelOtter I think she should be a little more appreciative of his time,False
lightCamel: she should have taught her parents English.,False
"excitedBison: Again, you lose nuance here in one sided conversation presentation, but I'd lean towards her overreacting with the husband suggesting they should have learned English or that he shouldn't be on call translation service",False
fulfilledZebra: It has started to interrupt her husband's time.,False
"novelOtter: I don't think she is considering his side of things and that it might not always be convenient for him to help her parents. However, I don't believe his comments were really very biased as she points out",False
brightHippo: I agree. I think that it is fair that she asked her husband for help but I dont think that is is his responsibility. ,False
lightCamel: Assilation is important.,False
openElephant: Also her parents can take advantage of some of the resources to begin to learn English a little better. I think at some point parents should not always rely on their children for help.,False
lightCamel: That means learning the language.,False
novelOtter: Agree with brightHippo I think its fine she's asking him to help but not at an all day every day basis,False
"fulfilledZebra: Due to her going back to school, she basically shoved all translation tasks over to her husband.",False
lightCamel: Listen...her husband speaks SPANISH>,False
lightCamel: They should learn english.,False
"novelOtter: I think her parents COULD apply themselves to learn the language and not rely on their daughter forever, but I do think she is being kind by helping them. ",False
lightCamel: Husband is right to be irritated.,False
brightHippo: I respect her opinion to be courteous and respectful to her parents and I think that she should continue to do that but I do not think that resonsibility should fall on her husband ,False
openElephant: Their success is ultimately tied to her success so if she doesn't have time to do minute tasks like translating then she should be able to communicate that to them.,False
"lightCamel: Hear, hear.",False
lightCamel: I totally think she is the asshole here.,False
openElephant: Her husband also can also work to appreciate the fact that she has assimilated on her own without anyone's help ,False
openElephant: meaning family*,False
lightCamel: Good for her.,False
openElephant: But yes she is the asshole because ultimately it is her problem to deal with not his.,False
"fulfilledZebra: She isn't a complete asshole, but she failed to consider how her husband is basically at her parents' beck and call for translation, so that makes her one.",False
"novelOtter: I think we are definitely considering both sides, but do we feel that the husband is being a little insensitive? I don't think he should have to help on the parent's schedule but maybe he could offer to help in general? ",False
novelOtter: Maybe he is just annoyed about the frequency,False
brightHippo: I think that there would be ways around this such as providing her parents with other resources or services which may help them translate without taking up her or her husbands time. ,False
"fulfilledZebra: It was fine when he translated a little bit here and there, but translation should be her job mostly.",False
novelOtter: Yes I agree ful,False
novelOtter: fulfilledZebra,False
lightCamel: Learning english is her parents duty.,False
brightHippo: I also think that they could find boundaries to draw such as how long they will be willing to help at one time,False
novelOtter: Definitely the asshole then,False
novelOtter: Exactly. BOUNDARIES!,False
fulfilledZebra: Asshole for not taking account of how the husband would feel about translating all the time.,False
"novelOtter: Yes and expecting him to stop and drop, not considering his time or feelings. Asshole. ",False
inquisitiveHippo: I think that this person is the asshole because I think there were better ways to handle this situation. ,False
lightHorse: This is the last situation replayed. He's right.,False
lightHorse: Not an asshole.,False
"openBear: This goes back to the last task's point. I think it is important to note that he did speak in a respectful tone, but overall his point was that he wanted her to be independent and helpful",False
curiousGorilla: I think he definitely showed his frustration but it didn't sound like he was disrespectful.,False
"fulfilledMonkey: Agree, not an asshole if he tactfully presented it",False
"openBear: I don't think he was the asshole here, if it was politely said",False
inquisitiveHippo: I think that if this person was frustrated with their MIL calling them for help that there would be better ways to address the situation rather than asking his MIL to stop calling him ,False
"lightHorse: Right, his wifes responsible for learning english.",False
curiousGorilla: I think that it is a cultural barrier. It seems that we are expected be independent the USA.,False
lightHorse: Wife's parents.,False
lightHorse: Sheesh.,False
"lightHorse: So, not an asshole.",False
curiousGorilla: I think that the wife is caught between the two cultures which is a part of the assimilation process.,False
"inquisitiveHippo: This is similar to the previous situation in that it should not be his responsibility to address tasks for the family, however I think that there would be ways around this. ",False
"openBear: I think independence is important in any case, any country. I believe that there is not an official language for sure, but if you cannot go anywhere without the help of your kids/someone else, then it is time to do something about it.",False
inquisitiveHippo: It seems as if the wife should also be involved as well as possibly other members of the family and that not all of the responsibility should fall on one person to help translate,False
"lightHorse: Hear, hear.",False
"openBear:  If you flip the situation and apply it to moving to somewhere else, I would certainly want to know the language where I move. If you move to France and can't buy groceries, you'd eventually need to learn French. ",False
"curiousGorilla: I agree with inquisitiveHippo It is the wife's responsibility to communicate this issue with her family. He is going to be considered the asshole by her family because he is an in-law, even if it is true.",False
brightDolphin: I think the reaction by the family makes him not the asshole.,False
brightDolphin: Them calling him racist and stuff,False
lightHorse: Agree. Learning the language of the country you leve in is a duty.,False
curiousGorilla: He needs to work on setting the boundary with his wife and then she needs to set the boundary with her family. It is just wrong how it was all handled.,False
brightDolphin: Overall a shitty situation though,False
curiousGorilla: But at the end of the day he is not the asshole.,False
curiousGorilla: say that bri,False
curiousGorilla: brightDolphin,False
"openBear: I agree, I don't think he should have been alone on this and could have gone about it differently, but either way I think he will be perceived as an asshole because he's stating the truth. ",False
"lightHorse: Yeah, racist to boot.",False
"curiousGorilla: Exactly, it is unfortunate that race was brought into it when it was a simple boundary issue.",False
openBear: So he is not the asshole because more or less he was trying to kindly help her parents be more independent. ,False
lightHorse: That's SOP.,False
eagerBison: I dom,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: This one has a gray area but in general I think he should be speaking english ,False
lightHippo: I think he should be speaking English.,False
fulfilledMonkey: I think she should be speaking English out of a common courtesy to her mom.,False
lightHippo: He is a guest at his mother’s house.,False
curiousHorse: i think he should be speaking english and then could translate to his husband in german,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: He is staying in his mothers house and it would be nice for her to be able to communicate with them more. And his husband would have opportunity to improve his english.,False
eagerBison: I don't think the person is an intentional Asshole. Just didn't think about mediating conversation with his mother and his husband. His husband can speak German but he could speak mostly English to translate and converse with his mother.,False
lightHippo: It doesn’t matter if his husband is uncomfortable with speaking English.,False
brightGorilla: I don't see a problem with her speaking German to her husband as long as she spends time speaking with her mother in ,False
"livelyOtter: Everyone present should speak and understand each other's languages, otherwise it is just rude",False
fulfilledMonkey: Why can't the guy have some consideration for himself and not be so squeamish?,False
brightGorilla: ...in English.,False
lightHippo: He should speak the language his mother speaks so she can be a part of the conversation.,False
delightedDolphin: I agree.  This one is tricky and should be used as a learning experience for everyone.  ,False
curiousHorse: i think he can play to both parties and it doesnt have to be a hard line english or german,False
"lightHippo: So, he is the asshole in this scenario.",False
"eagerBison: He just mentioned in the begining that his mother is housing and feeding them, speaking in English for this mother isn't bad. Then he can speak privately in German with his husband or simply translate",False
brightGorilla: The question is about the wife not the husband,False
"livelyOtter: Still, she offered them a roof over their head and a place to stay.",False
eagerBison: Both are male,False
"delightedDolphin: During this stay, everyone should be speaking English.  Next time, they should consider staying elsewhere.",False
fulfilledMonkey: I think he is the asshole definetly.,False
"brightGorilla: Oh, I see.",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: I agree lightHippo - I think he is more concerned with his hisbands feeling rather than his mother - he should consider them boith,False
fulfilledMonkey: But she is the asshole for not being accommodating to her mother.,False

curiousHorse: its two males..,False
lightHippo: I agree with you guys. He is the asshole.,False
"livelyOtter: he is an asshole because he doesn't respect other people,primarily his partner",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: Maybe the german husband is the biggest asshole if he doesn't try to accomodate his host,False
brightGorilla: The American man should have persuaded the German one to speak English,False
livelyOtter: Yes,False
"lightHippo: Yes, the American man is the asshole.",False
"eagerBison: Or if the German man still didn't want to speak English, the American man could have translated",False

brightBear: The mom just wants to be included.,False
eagerDolphin: This is totally disrespectful to a person,False
openBison: I think the mother is the asshole because she could have easily taken her son aside and spoken to him privately. ,False
lightZebra: The mom has the right to make such a request in her own home.,False
brightBear: She feels excluded when her son and his husband speak only French.,False
fulfilledGiraffe: i think the mother should be included and since she only speaks english speak english,False
eagerDolphin: In this scenario his mother,False
"livelyMonkey: I understand that the mother was upset. But I think she should have kept her thoughts to herself, or at least told her son in private.",False
brightBear: They are staying in her house so they should be respectful.,False
curiousHippo: I don't think the parent is an asshole but she should have spoken to her son privately about the matter.,False
"excitedCamel: Ok, am I crazy to think one should be accommodating?",False
brightBear: Include her in the conversations.,False
curiousHippo: Yes,False
eagerDolphin: yes,False
"openBison: Yes, the partner knows english and he is being somewhat disrepectful but she still should have confronted her son in private, then the son could have spoken to his husband. ",False
"excitedCamel: This is not hard. Have tact, decorum and respect. Speak in the language that your mom can understand.",False
eagerDolphin: she is not an asshole,False
lightZebra: The mother is being accommodating by allowing them to stay in her home.  They should return the favor by speaking the language she understands.,False
"curiousHippo: Main question though, is the parent the asshole for bringing it up?",False
curiousHippo: I don't think so.,False
lightZebra: I don't think so either.,False
excitedCamel: The mom is not the asshole.,False
fulfilledGiraffe: agreed,False

excitedCamel: The mom is definitely not the asshole. She should be respected.,False
eagerDolphin: This person is not an asshole,False
lightGiraffe: I think the guy is the asshole since he was rude to his mother in law,False
openHippo: The son-in-law was way out of order for the way that he expressed his frustration to his mother-in-law. HE could have simply not answered.,False
livelyOtter: I believe that the guy was an assole. He could have addressed the situation in a different way,False
delightedBear: I think he there could of be a nicer way to tell her .,False
fulfilledGorilla: I believe he was not an assole,False
openHippo: I definitely think the guy was an asshole and perhaps he could have gifted her a subscription to duolingo.,False
livelyOtter: Can you explain why fulfilledGorilla,False
lightGiraffe: He could have suggested english classes at a differnt time he did not have to do that to her in a time of need,False
fulfilledGorilla: He gave her sources to learn,False

fulfilledGorilla: And one should learn at least relational language of the country one live in,False
delightedBear: I think it may have been hard for her to understand it .Maybe she had a hard time learning the English .,False
openHippo: Many of times it is not what's being said it could be the underlying tone that even in the way he described it indicate that he is the asshole.,False
lightGiraffe: Yes he offered to help but it was because he felt incoviced by his mother in law he did not suggest it soley for her benifit,False
eagerCamel: He added a section at the bottom explaining that he didn't use the language in the main part of the story. ,False
"openHippo: Also, he could have expressed his frustration to his wife and not think that it was ok to address the mother-in-law in a rude manner because he was emotionally spent.",False
delightedBear: I think theway he talks about it and how it he acts makes him a asshole .,False
fulfilledGorilla: Its all not always about recism,False
eagerCamel: It is hard to tell tone from an online post. He was frustrated so it may have come across rude or he may have said it nicely.,False
fulfilledGorilla: She was a family and should not feel offended,False
openHippo: It may not be about racism but his language undertone suggest that he has a problem with people who come to the US and not learn the language.,False
livelyOtter: I feel that the mother in law could have reached out to her daughter for assistance and not always relying on her son in law,False
delightedBear: I think the others should have put thier selves in his shoes and looks to see how it felt . ,False
"openHippo: Also, he shouldn't have put himself in the position to be the ""translator"" and allowed his mother-in-law to handle her own business the best way she knew how.",False
lightGiraffe: I think that he should help his mother in law when she needs help it dose not seem like a major incovience to me,False

inquisitiveElephant: I think his partner should speak English while at his mother's house.,False

inspiredCamel: It;s just rude to ignore the mother by speaking a language she cannot understand. ,False

"brightZebra: In conclusion, the son needs to take charge here and approach this either by translating or insisting on a language they can all understand, he's an asshole for not doing these things.",False
novelGiraffe: It could have been an opportunity for the partner to improve his English. The mother-in-law could have been prepared to help him by complimenting and encouraging him as he tried his English.,False

"inspiredGorilla: This one's a lot tougher because I can see both sides. I think the OP is TA, though. I think asshole is a strong word for it.",False
fulfilledBear: I think that the son comes off as kind of standoffish using external circumstances (America is a land of immigrants) instead of trying to base things on the reality.,False

livelyZebra: I think it's reasonable for the guy to ask his husband to help the mother out.,False
"openOtter: I believe this person is the asshole. His husband should not be the go to for translation. If he can help, that's great, but the family should go to the son first.",False

brightHippo: How do you know it's not once a day? That's super annoying,False

livelyZebra: Just because his contributions come in the form of helping to translate doesn't really change anything.,False
novelCamel: is it that big of a deal though to translate for couple mins?,False
inspiredGorilla: I'm not saying he shouldnt help but he shouldn't just be expected to drop everything and do it whenever the mother needs when the child can translate fine themselves.,False
curiousGiraffe: No matter how many times....sometimes they just want the connection to family,False
"fulfilledBear: It's not the fact he has to do it every time, it's the fact that the Spanish family is refusing to change or adapt in any way whatsoever.",False

excitedGiraffe: He can kind of translate for her or something ,False
curiousDolphin: i hope he should be asshole,False
"curiousDolphin: guys , we should take all one decison",False

curiousOtter: the person is not a asshole,False
"fulfilledBison: Okay, I feel as though she is one, because, unlike the previous situation, she was in the conversation.",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: She is close minded and selfish,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: The world doesn't revolve around her,False
curiousOtter: speaking the language which the other person do not know ,False
excitedZebra: His son awake at room,False
"delightedHippo: she cannot speak French, so she was excluded",False
"fulfilledBison: But, just because they broke apart a little bit to talk, she became upset about it.",False
"openElephant: haha, i kind of agree, if it wasn't anything important, but she doesn't know that it isn't important",False
"inspiredHorse: I think if  the person can speak English but has an accent, they should speak English in her house.",False
livelyMonkey: speaking only english,False
curiousOtter: it s is some thing not correct and not moral as well,False
"lightCamel: Yeah, I would also like to know what exactly they were talking about, so I would know whether or not their sidebar was truly disrespectful.",False
delightedHippo: The son could translate for his partner some of the time,False
"fulfilledBison: Like, I understand that she was just upset for not being included, I agree, but IDK.",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: Being bilingual have an advantage,False
"openElephant: I don't think they needed to only speak English, but her son could have explained what they were saying in English ",False
openElephant: so she felt included ,False
"excitedZebra: When French is mother tongue, he spoke easily",False
"fulfilledBison: True, openElephant",False
lightCamel: I agree with openElephant,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: The woman in the story sounds like a Karen,False
curiousOtter: Since the the guy can  speak in English..They could have easily avoided speaking in French,False
delightedHippo: A Karen? Why?,False
livelyMonkey: Our friend was very serious talk going on living room,False
delightedHippo: there was no manager.,False
inspiredHorse: I agree with with curiousOtter,False
curiousOtter: Karen..why so,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: This is a free country. Everyone has right to speak whatever they want,False
"excitedZebra: he, suddenly stop ",False
"openElephant: It might be hard for him to speak in English or he isn't comfortable, but I don't think she was an asshole to ask ",False
delightedHippo: well we need to be unanimous here,False
curiousOtter: yes..that is correct..when you are alone ..you can do whatever you want...,False

"curiousOtter: as a group of peoples , you should stand in the side eof Moral",False
curiousOtter: the person is not asshole,False
inspiredHorse: I think they should've spoke english in her house,False
inspiredHorse: So I think she isn't an asshole.,False
curiousOtter: I agree..The person is not asshole,False
"lightCamel: I think she's not an asshole - she maybe could've handled it a little better, but I don't think she intended to do any harm.",False
"curiousHippo: Hi, all.  I believe that yes, she is the asshole.",False
lightCamel: I think this is an instance where compromise is needed.  I think he is being an asshole by not imagining a solution.,False
inquisitiveOtter: If they both know how to speak English then they should speak it when the mother is around so yes you're the asshole. ,False
eagerElephant: I don't think shes an asshole for making his husband comfortable,False
"curiousHippo: Her husband is not a child.  He is able to speak English, but he prefers not to.  ",False
"delightedMonkey: since he was at his mom's house for a visit, he should be more considerate and include the mom",False
lightCamel: Maybe only speak english at meals or something.,False
"curiousHippo: They are staying is her mother's house, and it is rude that they speak only German when she clearly does not.",False
inquisitiveOtter: They should try to accommodate both to be polite. ,False
eagerElephant: I understand speaking another language is rude with a nonspeaker in the room,False
"curiousHippo: She can make her husband comfortable by supporting him as he speaks English, and maybe teach mom a few words in German.",False
"lightCamel: I agree with delightedMonkey it is rude to do that in the mothers house, leaves the mother out of conversations.",False
lightCamel: I think what makes them an asshole is not looking for a compromise,False
inquisitiveOtter: Whats the point of them visiting if they clearly don't want to include her?,False
"novelZebra: i think he's NOT an asshole -- it's his choice to not speak English when sharing the the space w/ husband and mom. Mom is accusing him of being an asshole for not including her, suggesting his is about speaking English with mom and husband",False
"curiousHippo: Good point, inquisitiveOtter",False
lightCamel: agreed inqui,False
lightCamel: inquisitiveOtter,False
"delightedMonkey: also, the husband can understand english, he's just shy about it. so it's different to be able to understand/communicate in that language and not be 100% comfortable with it, vs blatantly leaving someone out",False
eagerElephant: I think the mother i overreaching by calling her son an asshole.,False
eagerElephant: She could have had a polite conversation,False
"lightCamel: The mother might be over reacting, but I think it was reasonable to expect them to want to spend time with her and converse.",False
"lightCamel: They were not demonstrating that they were interested, while she is providing lodging and meals.",False
"curiousHippo: They are visiting mom's house, after all.  They should make every effort to include mom in the conversation.",False
delightedMonkey: agree lightCamel,False
"novelZebra: i think her anger is misdirected though, since it seems like what she really wants is to connect with the son, not necessarily about speaking English in the presence of mother and the husband.",False
"fulfilledBear: Hello all.  I am thinking that she is not the asshole and it is a reasonable request, but might have been better made in private.",False
openCamel: Son thinks is OK that his mom felt  awkward while he and hubby were speaking French?,False
"openCamel: She is not the asshole, and I agree, fulfilledBear",False
"livelyElephant: my initial reaction is no, she is not the asshole. she could have addressed it differently but her request is not unreasonable",False
"delightedDolphin: hello, i said she is the asshole because i feel like she didn't have to say she found it disrespectful -- she could have simply asked them to speak in English instead.",False
"inquisitiveZebra: I dont think OP is an asshole, it is reasonable request",False
inquisitiveZebra: She was polite about it.,False
excitedGiraffe: I think her response may have been a little much which is what the son said but its a reasonable request to engage in conversation with her. ,False
"delightedDolphin: i disagree, i don't think she was polite about it",False
"fulfilledBear: delightedDolphin I think I agree that maybe she could have phrased it in a nicer way, but I don't think the sentiment is invalid.",False
"delightedDolphin: it mentioned she thought it was disrespectful, which is kind of accusatory. she didn't have to be.",False
livelyElephant: right - she didn't seem polite about it. it sounded like she had an outburst,False
livelyElephant: which makes me wonder - is she the asshole then??,False
"fulfilledBear: livelyElephant we only have her retelling of the story, but yes I think the tone of what she said would matter!",False
openCamel: Difficult NOT to read between the lines and assume she was impolite.,False
"delightedDolphin: tone does matter. i could be wrong, but the fact that the husband shut down and went upstairs suggests there may have been some harshness",False
livelyElephant: agreed delightedDolphin,False
excitedGiraffe: Agree its hard to tell without context was she just passing by their conversation or was she apart of it\,False
"openCamel: However, the request was valid.  It was her home, and son and SIL were leaving her out of the conversation.",False
fulfilledBear: Those are valid points openCamel I am rethinking my original stance,False
"delightedDolphin: 100%, her request is valid, but the way she went about it made her an asshole, in my opinion",False
livelyElephant: for them to react that way - she must've addressed it in a way that was disrespectful hersefl,False
"fulfilledBear: Well it is possible that she was an asshole, but the behavior was suboptimal as well",False
fulfilledBear: I think you have changed my mind,False
"livelyElephant: i've changed my mind as well, i think she was the asshole now",False
inquisitiveZebra: I could see that now.,False
"fulfilledBear: I think she is an asshole, maybe not a huge one, but as others have said, the husband probably doesn't storm off if she is very kind and says she wants to be included.",False
excitedGiraffe: Agree,False
"fulfilledBear: I think we all identified and empathized with her sentiment, but now I see more nuance.",False
brightElephant: Hello,False
excitedBison: I don't know they're the a-hole,False
"openZebra: Hi gang, So I definitely think this person is the asshole for not speaking english in his moms home",False
brightElephant: I don't think they are an asshole,False
brightElephant: I mean yeah i do,False
brightElephant: sorry,False
"curiousGiraffe: I was on the fence about this, but ultimately because they are in her mother's house and don't see her often, it is a little inconsiderate to almost exclusively speak another language around her. ",False
excitedBison: oops,False
brightElephant: He should have definitely spoken english ,False
"novelDolphin: I think that when in Rome applies to this scenario.  If you are in Germany then you speak German if you are in America then you speak English.  And not in a racist sense, but it helps to keep the brain healthy and flexible. ",False
excitedBison: He should have spoken English. ,False
excitedBison: My last phrase worded weird,False
brightElephant: I just don't get why he would go to his moms house,False
brightElephant: and then speak german,False
brightElephant: what kind of nonsense is that ,False
delightedGorilla: Agreed. Her mom even hosted them and provided meals,False
curiousGiraffe: right lol,False
excitedBison: ok. A-hole. Y or N?,False
brightElephant: Yes,False
novelDolphin: y,False
"curiousGiraffe: yes, ",False
delightedGorilla: Y,False
openZebra: since they are married they can talk to each other all the time in german. His husband should understand that he hasn't seen his mother as frequently and should speak english to her,False
"excitedBison: agreed, yes",False
openZebra: yes,False
brightElephant: so we are all in agreement,False
excitedBison: I believe so,False
"openZebra: is anyone thinking ""NO""?",False
openZebra: great! sounds like we all agree!,False
excitedBison: yay :),False
"novelDolphin: Yes, I considered both sides, but psychological and scientific data says that they are wrong.",False
brightElephant: Yeah I would not do what they person did,False
brightElephant: Like how can you sit with your mom and then not have her understand yo u,False
openZebra: So do we have to wait for the timer to run out now? ,False
brightElephant: Yeah pretty much,False
curiousGiraffe: Yeah it's inconsiderate ,False
excitedBison: *takes nap*,False
brightElephant: The name is brightElephant,False

curiousGiraffe: hurry hurry ,False
brightElephant: :(,False
lightElephant: Definitely yes,False
novelGorilla: the dad is not the ahole ,False
inquisitiveBison: I think the person is the asshole,False
novelGorilla: i think..or were we saying the son?,False
excitedOtter: I dont' think so at all,False
openMonkey: I don’t think the parent is an asshole. The parent just wanted to be included. The kids should have acted more considerately. ,False
excitedOtter: The person who asked the kids to speak in a common language was just asking for curtesy,False
"lightElephant: Dad, no. Son, yes",False
novelGorilla: Yeah I mean that's so awkward to speak another language in front of a non speaker,False
fulfilledCamel: I don't think they are an asshole,False
fulfilledCamel: The parent is not an ass,False
fulfilledCamel: The son is ,False
excitedOtter: The dad had the right to want to be included and speaking the language you suck at is just good practice,False
fulfilledCamel: The husband is,False
"inquisitiveBison: parent is the asshole. based on what they said, they didn't say there were ground rules about speaking english in the house prior or if they were actually included in the coversation",False
fulfilledCamel: Ok but pretend in your in the situation ,False
fulfilledCamel: Like you want to be included,False
excitedOtter: Kids are often self centered even when they become adults. ,False
fulfilledCamel: And he asked,False
inquisitiveBison: Was the conversation already happening and the parent walked in?,False
excitedOtter: Being asked to be included is not asshole material,False
inquisitiveBison: or was the kid speaking french to the parent?,False
"novelGorilla: If you're staying with someone, it's only fair you speak to them/around them in a way they can understand",False
excitedOtter: even if it was said in a snarky manner,False
novelGorilla: It says they were all in the living room together not that the dad walked in,False
"excitedOtter: Therefore parent not asshole, kid not necessarily asshole, but definitely selfish",False
inquisitiveBison: the kid is also 20,False
inquisitiveBison: the parent didn't say if the conversation was directed at the parent or not,False
fulfilledCamel: wow the kid is 20 and married,False
inquisitiveBison: maybe the parent interjected and just wanted to be the center of attention,False
novelGorilla: you can assume if they are all in a room together it would be a general discussion....,False
"fulfilledCamel: Wait so is parent asshole, Y or N",False
excitedOtter: N,False
inquisitiveBison: Y,False
openMonkey: N,False
novelGorilla: N,False
inquisitiveBison: firm Y,False
fulfilledCamel: N,False
novelGorilla: welp,False
lightElephant: n,False
fulfilledCamel: So i guess only one person saying yes,False
fulfilledCamel: can we convince you?,False
inquisitiveBison: I would conceded that they are both assholes. The parent didn't explain their story enough,False
"novelGorilla: we're not instigating about the full story, we are coming to a decision based off of information given",False
inquisitiveBison: to me it sounds like the kid was a typical 20yo asshole and the parent didn't explain their case well enough,False
novelGorilla: you're making assumptions outside of the provided text though,False
fulfilledCamel: I said no ,False
inquisitiveBison: so we are taking the parent at face value?,False
inquisitiveBison: that's their testimony ,False
novelGorilla: yes I mean idk why we wouldnt,False
fulfilledCamel: not everyone voted again,False
fulfilledCamel: :D,False
excitedCamel: After reading though I think she is the asshole because her husband understands and speaks english.,False
openElephant: The daughter was right in wanting to make her husband feel comfortable. ,False
curiousGorilla: I think the boyfriend should have made more effort to speak in English in respect for the mother.,False
"inquisitiveHorse: I can understand both points in this situation. His husband feels more comfortable, but he needs to think of his mom who has not seen in a while.",False
openElephant: The mother should not of reacted the way she did. ,False
inspiredBear: My initial impression is this person is the asshole. They went to visit the mother and to not include her in the conversation is rude,False
lightDolphin: Ya she can speak whatever language she wants but she should speak more english to include her mother. ,False
brightMonkey: I think the son was right in speaking German to the husband. How would the mom feel in Germany?,False
excitedCamel: If they are alone or in Germany it makes sense to speaks german but if they are around english speakers they should speak english if they can.,False
"inquisitiveHorse: I think it would be fine to speak in German when the mom is not around, but speak in English when the mom is around. Otherwise, why even visit her?",False
openElephant: They could of found a middle ground. ,False
curiousGorilla: I agree with excitedCamel,False
brightMonkey: I think that he could have maybe tried to help his husband be more comfortable speaking english.,False
inspiredBear: This person also makes the situation seem he has to choose between the mother and husband. In reality he can be encouraging toward the husband to use his english and include the mother in the conversation,False
excitedCamel: If it the other way around the husbands mom would expect german to be spoken I am sure. ,False
lightDolphin: Ya there should be some sort of hybrid model,False
brightMonkey: What if she doesn't know German though?,False
curiousGorilla: The mom absolutely shouldn't have responded the way she did and could have handled it a little more assertively.,False
"inspiredBear: If they weren't there specifically to visit the mother it might be different, but what's the point of visiting if you arent going to include her?",False
excitedCamel: Because all three can speak English it is the obvious choice while with the mother. ,False
"inquisitiveHorse: Yes, why visit her if they are not going to talk to her?",False
openElephant: I’m sure they could of communicated well enough if she translated for her mother. ,False
curiousGorilla: Is the mom supposed to sit there hearing German the entire time?,False
"brightMonkey: That does make sense. If they are there to see her, the son could have translated for his husband.",False
curiousGorilla: She might as well have ditched the both of them and gone to Germany at this point.,False
"inquisitiveHorse: The husband may feel uncomfortable speaking English, but I am sure he is in a non judgmental environment with people that could help him if he didn't understand anything.",False
brightMonkey: It would be a good place to practice his English.,False
lightDolphin: Ya the husband is mostly at fault here for being scared,False
inspiredBear: I think the best solution is for them to be more encouraging about their husbands english. Like inquisitiveHorse said it was most likely a non judgemental environment,False
brightMonkey: I agree with ins,False
brightMonkey: inspiredBear,False
openElephant: He is a guest. Make him feel comfortable. ,False
openElephant: I don’t think he is an asshole. ,False
openElephant: Others?,False
curiousGorilla: I think they are the asshole.,False
"inquisitiveHorse: Yes, I do think he is because he was not considerate of his mother, who they were there to visit.",False
"brightMonkey: I think he is the asshole, but not on purpose. I think there were a lot of other ways to have made him not the asshole that he didn't do.",False
"inspiredBear: I think the person is the asshole, maybe the mom over-reacted but they were rude to her in the first place.",False
lightDolphin: They all are at fault,False
openElephant: True ,False
curiousGorilla: Don't forget to vote.,False
curiousZebra: The mother is the subject?,False
delightedMonkey: I think that the mother approached the situation poorly making her the asshole.,False
fulfilledHorse: I don't think the mother was in the wrong at all.,False
"novelCamel: Yeah the mother is the subject, I think they are the asshole in this situatio",False
brightGiraffe: I feel like the mom is not the asshole. She was kind about asking for them to speak english.,False
openOtter: Ya it's her house they should make an effort to include her. ,False
curiousZebra: She is correct in wanting them to speak English but she could of approached it better. ,False
fulfilledHorse: She wanted to talk to the men and asked them to include her. They decided to get mad about it.,False
openOtter: Ya they overreacted inside of just talking it out,False
brightGiraffe: I think the son's partner was the asshole and the son was supporting him too much instead of his mom.,False
"novelCamel: In my opinion, it seemed like she didnt give them a chance before saying they were being disrespectful.",False
livelyBear: She could have worded it more assertively and politely.,False
curiousZebra: To speak dominantly in the language is inappropriate. ,False
delightedMonkey: I dont think its wrong that they wanted English but to jump right to saying she is disrespected instead of asking them to switch to english made it weird.,False
livelyBear: She could have asked them to try and speak English when she's around so she can be included.,False
brightGiraffe: It would be interesting to see how long they'd been there.,False
curiousZebra: It was childish for the one to storm away. ,False
delightedMonkey: She made everyone feel awkward when that wasn't necessary. ,False
brightGiraffe: I feel like the son and his partner overreacted by going upstairs.,False
novelCamel: For all we know the partner was just asking for the right words to say in english. She said that he does speak english but we dont know how well.,False
fulfilledHorse: It is rude to speak in a language the mother does not understand in front of her. They were excluding her.,False
curiousZebra: I’m sure there is more to this than what was written. ,False
delightedMonkey: If she were nice about it I think it would have played out differently.,False
livelyBear: It's not like she was sitting there being ignored while they were speaking French to each other.,False
curiousZebra: Definitely an over reaction. ,False
livelyBear: She walked in on them speaking French.,False
"fulfilledHorse: If they could all speak English, I don't understand why they didn't, just in front of the mother.",False
brightGiraffe: They were all together when the guys started speaking French,False
novelCamel: Yeah I dont think it's necessarily rude to speak a diff language in front of her. If they were only speaking french and leaving the mother left out it would be rude. But we lack context in that regard,False
curiousZebra: Did she give them the chance to finish their discussion in order for them to speak English to her. ,False
brightGiraffe: Not from the story - good point.,False
brightGiraffe: But she was already there.,False
delightedMonkey: The mom sounded like a Karen.,False
curiousZebra: She could of relayed her message in a more polite matter. ,False
fulfilledHorse: We probably do not know the whole story.,False
novelCamel: The way it was presented it seemed like she cut them off as soon as she heard french which doesn't sound very fair.,False
"fulfilledHorse: If she did that, then that is rude.",False
"brightGiraffe: It is rude, but maybe she'd been ignored all week and felt left out?",False
brightGiraffe: We just don't have that information.,False
"novelCamel: Maybe so, but I dont think we can assume that",False
curiousZebra: Interesting to see how breakfast goes. ,False
"fulfilledHorse: From the information I read, I felt it was rude to exclude her and not talk in English. I don't think she was the asshole.",False
"curiousZebra: If the subject is the mother, then I think she in the wrong. ",False
livelyBear: Don't forget to expand and vote on who you think the asshole was.,False
"brightGiraffe: I think they all suck, so I would say the mom is the asshole for cutting them off.",False
novelCamel: I think the mother is the asshole because it seemed she was not giving them a chance based on the information she provided.,False
"delightedDolphin: So, can we agree that his initial post is probably closer to reality than his attempt at redeeming himself at the end?",False
"fulfilledZebra: I can agree to that, tho I dont think hes an asshole",False
lightBison: I also don't think he's the asshole,False
"openOtter: I agree, his last ditch effort at explaining himself as not and asshole was unbelievable",False
eagerGiraffe: I dont think hes an asshole,False
inspiredHorse: I'd say that's just speculation.  Maybe they were venting their frustrations in the post.,False
novelHippo: I think he was in the way he was expressing himself.,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I do not agree that his initial post is who he is . . . it could be an expression of frustration. If he claims he was respectful, then I give him the benefit of that the doubt.",False
"livelyMonkey: yes. and while his frustration is understandable, and not exactly racist, it is rather insensitive",False
"openOtter: I think he could have ""encouraged"" her differently, more positively",False
eagerGiraffe: He married his wife knowing this may be an issue,False
novelHippo: Was he venting yes in a very asshole way.,False
"lightBison: I think at the worst he was probably a little harsh/unkind, but I do think it was somewhat warranted",False
openOtter: He came off as an asshole even if it wasn't his intent,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I would be really annoyed too.  As long as he was not rude, he is not an asshole in my book.",False
novelHippo: Very true he knew the situation he was marrying into,False
"delightedDolphin: He was the asshole in his venting, but it is an understandable frustration",False
"fulfilledZebra: I think he could have approached the conversation differently with her, or tried to get some family members on board to help talk to her along with him",False
eagerGiraffe: agreed delightedDolphin,False
openOtter: The way he tried to explain their background and how she's been in the country 8 yrs and SHOULD speak spanish already?,False
inspiredHorse: If he explained the situation as he described at the end then it sounds like he was being respectful.,False
delightedDolphin: I think he definitely hurt her feelings and that turned the family against him,False
inquisitiveCamel: He was actually quite mature in addressing the situation--though he doesn't seem to understand that not everyone learns languages easily.,False
lightBison: He knew the situation he was marrying into but that doesn't mean he's responsible for handling her day to day needs. That's not his responsibility,False
fulfilledZebra: People often embelish what they write out when they are in the heat of the moment. ,False
eagerGiraffe: He hurt her feelings but maybe now she will learn,False
novelHippo: I appreciate the use of different educational ideals but again know the culture.,False
"delightedDolphin: But yeah, older people have a much more difficult time learning the language",False
livelyMonkey: How could he not know that by doing this it would make others in the family upset,False
inspiredHorse: I don't think that's the point,False
"inquisitiveCamel: I conclude that he could have handled it better perhaps, more diplomatically, but he is no asshole in addressing a very annoying situation.",False
"openOtter: I feel he's thinks assholishly, he came across more condescending than frustrated",False
delightedDolphin: I think he's moderately the asshole,False
"fulfilledZebra: Thats true, but there are so many ways to learn something, even if its slow, theres bound to be some progress, even just so she can function better out in society",False
eagerGiraffe: livelyMonkey I feel that the family should encourage her to learn,False
"delightedDolphin: As RSlash would say, 3 out of 5 buttholes",False
"openOtter: He was part of the problem, he waited 8 years to decide it was a problen",False
"fulfilledZebra: I agree, the family should encourage her to learn. even if its just enough to be able to get by in public. ",False
eagerGiraffe: openOtter very true,False
"livelyMonkey: agreed, they should encourage her, but there may have been far better ways of going about this",False
inspiredHorse: Maybe he was just afraid to mention it.  I know I'd be nervous to say something like that.,False
inquisitiveCamel: 8 years---I would say he was quite patient.,False
delightedDolphin: It kind of sounds like she's relying more and more on him instead of the rest of the family because they're making themselves available as much to her,False
lightBison: Agreed inspiredHorse,False
eagerGiraffe: Sometimes it takes a kick in the pants to make a person realize that they should learn.,False
"openOtter: He mentions how easy and fast he was able to learn other languages, i think he thinks less of her",False
"delightedDolphin: If he put up with it for 8 years, it clearly didn't really start bothering him until recently",False
delightedDolphin: So something likely changed,False
"inspiredHorse: He could have just said he wouldn't help her anymore, but instead offered to help her learn the language.  Teach a man to fish...",False
"livelyMonkey: agreed, openOtter",False
inquisitiveCamel: maybe it did bother him--maybe he is just patient and wanted to give her time,False
fulfilledZebra: i think hes probably the main translator now and its taking up to much of his time. ,False
"lightBison: He was definitely condescending in his perception of language, but she also didn't even make an effort. ",False
fulfilledZebra: who knows what kind of work life he has,False
eagerGiraffe: fulfilledZebra ,False
eagerGiraffe: He was not an asshole,False
fulfilledZebra: not an asshole,False
inquisitiveCamel: why did they accuse him of being racist? He married a Guatemalan . . . that points away from racist,False
delightedDolphin: I came in thinking he is the asshole but I agree with the group now that he's probably not,False
"openOtter: he seemed disgusted that she didn't learn English yet, I think his offer to help was more egotitical than encouraging",False
inquisitiveCamel: not as asshole,False
"inspiredHorse: I think that while it's possible he came on a little strong, his intentions were good; he is not the asshole.",False
"openOtter: ok, so not",False
"livelyMonkey: i guess not, but still could have been handled better",False
delightedDolphin: At least no more than the rest of the family for not trying to help her more for 8 years,False
openMonkey: This is a tough one.,False
brightOtter: I think she's the asshole.,False
inquisitiveBison: So she's mad at him for not liking her dump her parents on him all the time,False
excitedCamel: I felt that she was overwhelmed by her situation.,False
"lightBear: I agree, Personally im leaning towards shes the asshole",False
inquisitiveBison: I definitely think she's the asshole,False
curiousGiraffe: It is assholish for her to pass the responsibilty of her mother to her husband,False
livelyGorilla: The key is she admits she is trying to 'make my husband . . .' do it,False
"brightOtter: If she doesn't have time for her Mom, than why should he?",False
excitedCamel: I don't feel she is an asshole.,False
inspiredZebra: I think it shouldn't be a problem as long is its not all the time,False
inquisitiveBison: She flat out said she dumped it off on him,False
"curiousGiraffe: if it shouldn't be a problem for him to spare 10mins, why can't she also spare that time for her own mother?",False
excitedCamel: Again when you marry into hispanic culture you have to care for the parents.,False
inquisitiveBison: Because she values her time more than she values his,False
lightBear: i hated the fact that she said she felt she had to be t he trailblazer for her family and lead the way. she couldnt have thought to teach her parents some english as she was learning it?,False
"livelyGorilla: she is in the wrong . . . she shouldn't be making him, pressuring him . . . she should be helping her mom herself, or getting her mom a translator",False
"brightOtter: Yeah, but she's not. She's making her husband do it and doing something else she prefers to do.",False
"openMonkey: I feel like the way she's talking about her husband is pretty assholeish, but I don't think asking for his help is necessarily a bad thing.",False
excitedCamel: He knew what he was marrying into.,False
"curiousGiraffe: she has no right to get mad at him for not wanting to do it, she doesn't even want to do it",False
inquisitiveBison: They also make fun of him and call him a gringo,False
"livelyGorilla: asking him for help is not bad, but 'making him', that is pressuring, manipulating, etc. is",False
"brightOtter: Asking for his help isn't a bad thing, but making him do something she won't make time for is unfair.",False
excitedCamel: He had to communicate in spanish before.,False
inspiredZebra: It is completely understandable to ask for help occasionally,False
openMonkey: Great point curiousGiraffe,False
livelyGorilla: this one is pretty easy for me . . . she is in the wrong,False
curiousGiraffe: i think she is simply an asshole for being mad about it,False
"inquisitiveBison: Oh yeah, if she asked and he was willing help then sure",False
excitedCamel: Help is part of marriage when  you are supporting each other,False
"inquisitiveBison: But she literally said ""I'm busy so I made him do it""",False
"inspiredZebra: She even said she was working full time, while going to school for her masters",False
"lightBear: Occasional help is better than feeling like your life is on hold, which is what the husband feels like.",False
"brightOtter: Yeah but it's not an equal trade off. She's putting her half all on him, that's not fair.",False
"livelyGorilla: helping is a gift, you can't make someone do it ",False
inquisitiveBison: She's not considering her husband at all,False
curiousGiraffe: she is putting more expectations on him than she is willing to do.. for her own mother,False
livelyGorilla: she is blinded by her desire to be the savior of her family,False
"curiousGiraffe: she is also an enabler, she never thought to even help her parents learn english",False
inquisitiveBison: Her parents should have learned how to navigate in the country the immigrated to,False
"lightBear: I feel like she doesnt think her parents should have to learn english, based on what she said at the end about working hard and they dont need that on top of everything else",False
excitedCamel: Hello not being a savior but bettering her self through education,False
livelyGorilla: she should ease up and then her husband might feel less pressure and want to help,False
"openMonkey: I can understand why she's upset, but it's just a bit too strong.",False
inspiredZebra: good way of putting it livelyGorilla,False
"brightOtter: He has a job, responsibilities and parents to take care of too. He can't do all this for her while she does nothing.",False
excitedCamel: I guess none of you went back to school with a family.,False
openMonkey: Perhaps if they had a decent conversation about it they could talk it out like adults.,False
"livelyGorilla: actually, I did, a phd program",False
curiousGiraffe: The simple fact that she's mad she can't throw this off on her husband and is mad about it makes her an asshole,False
"inquisitiveBison: Honestly, if she's working on her masters while working full time then she's not likely taking a full time school schedule or her work is not horribly stressful",False
excitedCamel: Life is hard that is why spouses pick up when things get tough.,False
curiousGiraffe: its like its her way or ot ok,False
inquisitiveBison: As someone who worked full time while pursuing a masters full time,False
"brightOtter: Maybe her other family members could take on this responsibility, if she's so busy and it's so important to take care of their parents.",False
excitedCamel: Even for the inlaws whether you like them or no.,False
livelyGorilla: there have to be other people who can help--why does it have to be her husband?,False
"curiousGiraffe: he married into the family, they've been her family forever",False
lightBear: Thats a good idea - maybe the husband can be back up to the other family members,False
"inquisitiveBison: Yeah, they've just become his responsibility all the time without even talking to him about it first",False
curiousGiraffe: she's not taking an of the responsibility or blame,False
excitedCamel: Didn't say if they had other familu,False
lightBear: I would be curious to know what the other family members do. are they in school? working? at home? ,False
excitedCamel: UH she had been the support up until the masters,False
inquisitiveBison: I'm full on set she is the asshole here,False
excitedCamel: So hubby has been helping for how long.,False
livelyGorilla: her attitude of 'making him' says it all,False
brightOtter: 100% the asshole,False
"curiousGiraffe: i think she's got some underlying issues, with control and teasing him with gringo",False
excitedCamel: Nope not an asshole,False
livelyGorilla: she is the ah,False
curiousGiraffe: like she doesn't reeally respect him,False
curiousGiraffe: im gonns say is,False
"inquisitiveBison: She sounds like she believes her time is more important than his, while he's likely making more at his job to support them",False
lightBear: I agree shes the asshole - she doesnt respect her husband and is trying to push of something that should be a joint responsibility onto him.,False
inspiredZebra: Well I think she is not the asshole considering the circumstance,False
openMonkey: The writer is acting very disrespectful in this scenario and isn't considering the feelings of her husband; she is the asshole.,False
livelyZebra: Hello,False
inquisitiveBison: hi,False
brightDolphin: hello,False
inspiredBear: Hello,False
eagerMonkey: HI,False
curiousOtter: Hi,False
inquisitiveBison: My impression is that the guy is the asshole.,False
inspiredBear: I think that the daughter is the asshole by not interpreting and/or at least encouraging her husband to use his English,False
livelyZebra: I agree,False
inquisitiveBison: I think they're both men btw,False
"inquisitiveBison: ""I'm American (25M) and recently married a German guy (23M).""",False
"inspiredBear: The husband is definitely an asshole, but we're judging the (oops my mistake) woman's child here.",False
"excitedCamel: No daughter, son.",False
inspiredBear: I misread thank you for calling that out!,False
brightDolphin: The two men went to visit his American mother so they should have respected HER.,False
"livelyZebra: I mean, it seems the german guy could probably at least listen to the english",False
eagerMonkey: Yes I also agree definitively an asshole,False
curiousOtter: I think she should encourage him to feel more comfortable in speaking English ,False
"excitedCamel: All three of them are assholes for different reasons, but the son is the biggest asshole for not accommodating his mother after she voiced her concern.",False
"fulfilledHippo: I dont think he was an asshole, but I can definitely see the mother's POV. she felt left out.  ",False
inspiredBear: curiousOtter I mispoke. It's a homosexual marriage,False
"delightedGorilla: I believe that the daughter seems exclusive, even if she has good intetntions.  It's easy to incorporate her mother.  Her mother can't switch to German, but her husband can to English.  I think it show thoughtfulness to speak English.",False
"inquisitiveBison: Yeah essentially I think that it's okay for the bf to speak german, but he should have translated for his mother",False
inspiredBear: There was little to no effort provided by the new husband to even bond with his MIL,False
eagerMonkey: It is two men,False
inspiredBear: At a minimum the son should've translated so the mother didn't feel as though she was watching a movie about her son's life,False
"livelyZebra: Yea, its not like he is a major asshole. But in this case, if one has to chose, it seems like the american guy could have done more to make his mother feel at ease",False
"excitedCamel: The husband is an asshole and kind of rude as a guest, the mother is an asshole and kind of rude as a host, but the son is the rudest. His mother makes a good point that she hardly gets to see him and wants to participate while he's there.",False
"brightDolphin: I agree, the German husband can at least listen in English rather than making his mother-in-law feel left out in her own home.",False
"delightedGorilla: Oops, yes replace my ""daughter"" with ""husband""",False
curiousOtter: I agree with you inspiredBear,False
fulfilledHippo: The son could have tried to translate for his mother what they were talking about or encouraged his partner to speak english,False
curiousOtter: There should have been more of an effort there,False
inspiredBear: Agree entirely,False
inquisitiveBison: I agree with what everyone is saying,False
eagerMonkey: I also agree,False
inspiredBear: I believe we have reached a collective opinion.,False
delightedGorilla: So have we come to the conclusion that the son is the asshole,False
"livelyZebra: And as for the german husband, the only way his english will improve is to listen and speak it more. Considering he is married to an American, he should work on his english just like the american likely worked on his German.",False
"inquisitiveBison: yeah, I think we all generally agree",False
eagerMonkey: Yes we have.,False
livelyZebra: Yep,False
"curiousOtter: Yes, we have. ",False
"inspiredBear: The bot pushed me to write in complete sentences, sorry. Yes I velieve we all agree.",False
brightDolphin: Indeed.  Son is an asshole!,False
inspiredBear: believe**,False
"excitedCamel: The mother should have been more accommodating of her guest, the husband should have made more of an effort to speak in English just for the visit, but the son is the biggest asshole.",False
inquisitiveBison: good point livelyZebra,False
eagerMonkey: So we all agree the son is the biggest asshole.,False
excitedCamel: Agreed.,False
curiousOtter: Agreed. ,False
"livelyZebra: Yes, agreed.",False
"inquisitiveBison: I do see why the son wanted to be on the side of his bf, but he seems to have gotten stuck in his own world",False
"inspiredBear: excitedCamel you're right. Multiple areas of more effort, but if the son told the mother that her husband could speak at least a bit of English, she probably felt as though they could bond and work through it together. I don't see the",False
inspiredBear: mother being malicious like the husband is.,False
"livelyZebra: Yes, I agree inspiredBear",False
"inspiredBear: The husband is actively choosing to not include the MIL, and the son is enabling the behavior.",False
inquisitiveBison: Yeah...,False
fulfilledHippo: They were both assholes. But I guess the son won for the biggest asshole,False
inspiredBear: Don't forget to expand the box to vote guys.,False
livelyZebra: yes fulfilledHippo that's true. It isn't totally black and white.,False
"inquisitiveBison: I get that the husband is nervous, and the MIL is maybe getting too worked up over it, but the son is one not even trying to make any connection between them",False
delightedGorilla: The husband is the asshole because the simple solution is to include everyone.,False
"brightDolphin: Both the son and the husband are disrespecting the mother-in-law they came to see, by not speaking English in her English home.",False
eagerMonkey: Yes I agree also with Inspired Bear in,False
inspiredBear: We can stop discussing and just vote now if you all like,False
curiousDolphin: Hi everyone,False
delightedElephant: Hello,False
inspiredMonkey: Hi,False
brightHorse: Hi all!,False
delightedElephant: this is kinda the reverse of the first scenario,False
eagerZebra: This is just like the first one but in reverse.,False
curiousDolphin: This reminds me of the first AITA except from the Mother's point of view (and French ha),False
"excitedBear: If her description of the event is actually accurate (may not be), she wouldn't be the asshole.",False
delightedElephant: haha same thoughts eagerZebra,False
excitedBear: curiousDolphin exactly!,False
eagerZebra: yes delightedElephant,False
curiousDolphin: I agree excitedBear,False
"delightedElephant: yeah, it's a fair request",False
eagerZebra: The mother is not an asshole,False
delightedElephant: I don't think she was impolite about it,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Yup, definitely like the first scenario.",False
"openCamel: So I think the son is being the asshole because they were all sitting together, the husband can speak English, why wouldn't they just speak English?",False
brightHorse: I am a lttle conflicted because this wouldn't be a coversation at all if her delviery wasn't off,False
"inquisitiveOtter: I dont think the mother is an ass, but the so is",False
curiousDolphin: I think that the couple was actively putting up a boundary so that they didn't have to be involved with small talk.,False
"excitedBear: She may have THOUGHT she explained gently and nicely, but it may not have been taken that way. Still, it's a reasonable request.",False
delightedElephant: if you're in the room with someone else it's only right to ensure they can participate in coversation,False
inquisitiveOtter: but the son is,False
inspiredMonkey: I don't think she was an asshole at all. She was kind about it,False
curiousDolphin: There is quite the room for misunderstanding tact with a language barrier.,False
eagerZebra: She was very nice.,False
brightHorse: She immediately went on the offensive and I think that's where the problem arose. I think she's right to want to be included though,False
openCamel: I agree delightedElephant,False
excitedBear: She SAYS she was nice.,False
delightedElephant: yeah it's possible she is thinking she was more polite than she is,False
"inquisitiveOtter: I fell like they were being disrespectful after she asked them to include her, and they immediately stopped talking & the husband left",False
inquisitiveOtter: *feel,False
"inspiredMonkey: That is true. She did say she nicely asked, but it was interpreted wrong ",False
"brightHorse: In the son's defense, it couldv'e been a mundane conversation that they didn't think they needed to include her in",False
"excitedBear: It's possible there's something she doesn't know, like the dude is self-conscious about his English or something. Still, that isn't a fault of hers.",False
"curiousDolphin: I believe that feeling left out of your child's life and watching their experiences pass you by with little to no ability to join in and show support is hard for any parent. I don't have kids, but it seems like that with my mom",False
"eagerZebra: I will say that the Engligh language could be more abrasive than the romantic French but she was polite, for an English woman.",False
"brightHorse: I still think that she is not the asshole, the delivery was just where things fell apart",False
"openCamel: possibly true that she was rude but ultimately, its only fair to speak the language that everyone in the room can speak rather than leaving someone out.",False
delightedElephant: all the son needs to do is translate for the mother,False
brightHorse: agreed openCamel,False
brightHorse: agreed delightedElephant,False
curiousDolphin: There's no need to translate if the husband knows english well enough to communicate,False
eagerZebra: agreed cur,False
curiousDolphin: The husband was ACTIVELY refusing to visit with the mom,False
"delightedElephant: if it was only for 1 second that they were speaking french, that's one thing, but if it was most of the time, then they seriously are excluding her",False
eagerZebra: curiousDolphin,False
openCamel: It would be different if the husband could not speak English but it sounds like he can so there is no problem for them all to simply speak English.,False
"inquisitiveOtter: Yes I agree if they at least translate for their mothers, maybe they wouldn't feel so left out ",False
"excitedBear: It would seem we're largely on the same page, then?",False
eagerZebra: yes,False
delightedElephant: yup,False
inquisitiveOtter: yes\,False
brightHorse: I think so!,False
curiousDolphin: Yes excitedBear this is true!,False
inspiredMonkey: yup,False
"openCamel: Yes, I think this person was not the asshole, the son was.",False
eagerZebra: correct openCamel,False
"curiousDolphin: openCamel the only place I disagree is placing the blame on the husband, not the son. The husband chose to be rude, the son enabled it, and the mother...well she tried at least.",False
eagerZebra: agreed,False
"curiousDolphin: It's an unfortunate (but apparently common) issue to have with your child, and as they're a newlywed. ",False
eagerZebra: curiousDolphin minds in sync,False
openCamel: Fair curiousDolphin ,False
"excitedBear: I suspect there may be more to the husband's reaction, like a psychological issue he can't just easily choose to control. The son definitely enabled, though.",False
curiousDolphin: It's hard to give space you're not used to when you've spent someone's whole life being their support system. I'm sure that's a shock as well.,False
brightHorse: I wonder if it would've made any difference if the mother had asked the son in private (instead of in the moment in front of the partner),False
"excitedBear: It was the son's role to smooth out the situation between the two of them, and he failed that.",False
"delightedElephant: the only thing I'm trying to be consious of, is, would I have the same opinion if I hadn't seen the first scenario we looked at and previously formed an opinion about this situation",False
curiousDolphin: I had to consciously compartmentalize it and look at this OPs husband's ability to create a judgement that was unbiased.,False
curiousDolphin: Don't forget to vote!!,False
delightedElephant: good strategy,False
brightHorse: Hi guys,False
curiousMonkey: Hi,False
livelyHippo: hi,False
openDolphin: Hi there,False
"novelGiraffe: hello, I think he's an asshole.",False
fulfilledCamel: Hello,False
openDolphin: I don't believe he's the asshole.  He has his own life to live and his MIL needs to stop being a crutch after so many years.,False
"inquisitiveBear: I am voting that this guy is being the asshole, but it is his decision to make, he's just not going to be looked at well by his in laws ",False
fulfilledCamel: I think he is asshole,False
curiousMonkey: Yeah I think So,False
brightHorse: How did you say that he is asshole,False
openDolphin: He's the asshole because he can't drop everything to help every time his MIL can't speak English to someone?,False
livelyHippo: I dont think that he is an asshole,False
excitedGorilla: I think the question of this person being an asshole depends on which situation we're talking about. ,False
"excitedGorilla: If we're talking about him telling him MIL he doesn't want to be a translator, I say no. If we're talking about the attitude of his entire post, I say yes. ",False
inquisitiveBear: i agree with excitedGorilla,False
livelyHippo: He just wants his mother in law to learn eglish and i think that he would eb proud of her for being more self reliant ,False
fulfilledCamel: I am also ,False
curiousMonkey: Yeah he is correct,False
"openDolphin: His attitude was fine, I think.  He didn't tell her he was tired of her shit",False
"novelGiraffe: Asshole because he's so smart but not enough to be willing to teach her but instead giving her ""resources"" to teach herself?  Anybody with the skills he claims to posses would have the ability to educated anybody who is unable to speak.",False
"excitedGorilla: I don't think it's an unwillingness to help, but more setting boundaries. It's unreasonable to be expected to help someone constantly. ",False
openDolphin: Agreed with excitedGorilla,False
livelyHippo: On the other hand his mother in law is old and she may have a difficult time learning spanish ,False
inquisitiveBear: there is also the fact that he is dealing with family too...he's kind of stuck w/them unless he divorces,False
"novelGiraffe: if he teaches her then in short-time he doesnt need to be a translate, time well spent.",False
"excitedGorilla: Yes, but being in the same family doesn't mean you can't have boundaries, or that you should be forced to do things you don't want to do. ",False
"brightHorse: because he's so smart but not enough to be willing to teach her but instead giving her ""resources"" to teach herself? Anybody with the skills he claims to posses would have the ability to educated anybody",False
livelyHippo: He my be a little bit condisinding but i think his intentions were good,False
inquisitiveBear: asshole is a perspective...in this case it seems his whole family thinks he's being an asshole,False
curiousMonkey: Yeah I agree with livelyHippo,False
excitedGorilla: But just because you can doesn't mean you should have to. I have a math degree but I don't help everyone in my family figure out their math homework. ,False
"novelGiraffe: he learns well, but teaches poorly. i say asshole.",False
"openDolphin: He's not her teacher.  Again, he shouldn't have to be a crutch for their entire lives.  She has to want to help herself too",False
"inquisitiveBear: he can take a stance, but now his whole fam hates him lol",False
novelGiraffe: its how he treated her thats assholish too,False
inquisitiveBear: alone and not teaching english or jsut do it to avoid huge family problems,False
inquisitiveBear: agree,False
novelGiraffe: there are ways to tell her kindly but he didnt,False
excitedGorilla: But he says that he didn't actually say what was originally posted. He says he was respectful.,False
openDolphin: He didn't treat her like one.  Did you read the edit novelGiraffe,False

eagerBison: Yeah I think he is asshole,False
"fulfilledDolphin: It is unreasonable to expect someone to help constantly. While it is nice to help sometimes, it should never be expected. ",False
inquisitiveOtter: Because he would not support his families need for a translator at all,False
inspiredElephant: doesnt know gringos are not into being translators,False
inquisitiveOtter: He let his wife down and he was mean to his grandmother. ,False
lightHippo: yeah she is a asshole for sure,False
"delightedBear: i doesn't sound like constantly if it's just like 10 mins from what she's saying, every once in a while, it sounds like she wants him to help out is all",False
"fulfilledDolphin: It's not in question if HE is an asshole. It's being questioned if SHE is. And I say yes, for expecting someone to help no matter what. You should never EXPECT help. Help is like a gift. ",False
excitedGiraffe: YES,False
inquisitiveOtter: His wife also had a point when she said he was disrespecting them becuase they had been in the us for a while,False
"inspiredElephant: Not AH...she translated for years, Currently working FT and in school for Masters..",False
livelyMonkey: Agreed with fulfilledDolphin,False
eagerBison: Currently working FT and in school for Masters..,False
delightedBear: i think if they have close familial bonds that may not be jsut a favor but an expectation to help family,False
lightHippo: yes she is correct,False
inquisitiveOtter: So she should have translated?,False
livelyMonkey: She's too busy for her family,False
"inspiredElephant: He does make a point that it could be too much but AH, no?",False
livelyMonkey: so he has to help now?,False
excitedGiraffe: yES,False
"fulfilledDolphin: I am have a math degree. I help out family member when I can when they need help. I would be really irritated if it was just expected though. I have a family of my own, a job, a life. ",False

fulfilledDolphin: Constant interruptions and expectations would be overwhelming. ,False
"inspiredElephant: theyre married so yeah, help each other out especially when you have more free time",False
lightHippo: what the hell is happening on her life?,False
"livelyMonkey: help, agreed.  He's at their mercy ",False
inspiredElephant: She could asked her mom to ask for help less just to start,False
livelyMonkey: His MIL is calling him directly because SHE won't answer her calls.,False
"delightedBear: maybe cultural expectation, i am from a culture where if you don't help your elders or family, it is very disprectful, perhaps that is the case in their fam",False
livelyMonkey: and she has siblings....who presumably understand English,False
inspiredElephant: SHE working FT and in school for Masters,False
lightHippo: She could asked her mom to ask for help less just to start.i gree with thuis,False
"fulfilledDolphin: It would really depend on how often it happens. If she expects it like 5 times a year, then it's not unreasonable. But a few times a week? Definitely unreasonable. ",False
inquisitiveOtter: The wife does need to consider that she would be better at translating.,False
inspiredElephant: Asshole is too strong of a word in this situation,False
"excitedGiraffe: eally depend on how often it happens. If she expects it like 5 times a year, then it's not unreasonable. But a few times a week? Definitely unreasonable",False

delightedDolphin: I don't see what is so hard in translating something,False
inspiredMonkey: Clearly the husband and wife need to communicate better and get on the same page about things,False

lightOtter: I feel like they all just need better communication.,False
delightedDolphin: The husband should devote atleast 10 minutes to help his family that he married into,False

inquisitiveGorilla: do you think the person is being an asshole ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: i think he is not an asshole,False
brightGiraffe: To me he's not an asshole,False
fulfilledBear: I'm torn with this. I don't think the mom was completely wrong but I think she could have taken her son to the side and told him it made her uncomfortable that they speak only in French.,False
inquisitiveGorilla: it is rude to have a conversation that makes a party of the conversation feel left out especially in his house,False
"openMonkey: to me. i dont see what she did as something wrong, i just think she could have told them she would like to joint the discussion.",False
brightGiraffe: You're actually correct. That's the right thing to do instead of saying that at the presence of his son's partner,False
fulfilledBear: Yes so in a sense she is the asshole because of the way she handled it.,False
"inspiredHorse: he also speaks english perfectly, there was no reason for the french",False
fulfilledBear: Right,False
brightGiraffe: She acted in a non acceptable way making her an asshole,False

"openMonkey: to me, i tink the son is the asshole, his mom mad a mistake he could have told her its ok and it would not happen again and try to explain things to his partner",False

fulfilledBear: I think so to. That's why I said I was torn on this one.,False
"inspiredHorse: and we are voting on whether the mom is the asshole or not, she did nothing but nioely ask her son",False
brightGiraffe: So what are we concluding on?,False
brightGiraffe: Is she an asshole or not?,False

lightZebra: hi,False
curiousCamel: Hello,False
openBear: hi,False
novelHorse: hi,False
lightZebra: lets discuss the issue,False
openBear: I think this person is the a**hole.,False

"eagerHippo: This was a borderline one to me, but still ass",False
curiousCamel: She not an asshole,False
lightZebra: i think this person is an asshole ,False
novelHorse: to mean i think the son and her partner is the asshole,False
openBear: The hasn't seen him in a long time. During his stay he could have made time to talk and catch up with her.,False
openBear: SHE*,False
"eagerHippo: mother is putting them up, feeding them, he does not see her often, and they still can't speak english with her??",False
novelHorse: she has a very good reason for wanting to be part of her sons discusion,False
curiousCamel: She wanted to make her husband comfortable I guess switching to his language is the right thing to do,False
lightZebra: she has notseen her son in a long time and only wants to be involved so as to get to know more about him and his partner,False
eagerHippo: the only she here is the mom,False
novelHorse: yh,False
curiousCamel: You have to be comfortable in your in-laws house to make a relationship work. ,False
lightZebra: yes its okay to want to make his husband feel comfortable but he should understand he has limited time with his mom,False
novelHorse: yes and i think her son should be able to make compromises for his mum,False
"eagerHippo: with what she has done for them, they still won't speak with her??",False
openBear: Its okay to want to make your spouse feel comfortable but this is his mom who he doesn't get to see very much. ,False
curiousCamel: He has always been with his mom before he got wedded. I don't see any fuse in this.,False
curiousCamel: Or what do you guys think?,False
openBear: I think the son is definitely the a**hole in this one.,False
lightZebra: please do not  forget to take the poll,False
delightedBison: I do not think OP is an asshole; he is just trying to make his husband feel comfortable.,False
"livelyMonkey: After reading the scenario, I can see it from both perspectives.",False
inspiredDolphin: I think he should have to speak in what ever language he wants to ,False
"fulfilledCamel: yes, you are and asshole and your husband is too. You are a guest in your Mother's home and should speak English.",False
livelyMonkey: I can see how the daughter wants to make sure her husband is kept in the loop and the mother doesn't want to be left out.,False
"delightedBison: He only has to deal with his mother temporarily, but he has to live with his husband everyday. I think it is more important to keep the husband happy.",False
lightZebra: I think since her mom is hosting them and she is only with her for a limited time she should try to accomodate her mother,False
fulfilledCamel: Your husband should use this opportunity to learn English phrases and innuendos better. It is a great time since he is with family.,False
livelyMonkey: I do not believe the daughter is an asshole because she is accommodating her husband.,False
fulfilledCamel: What about her Mom who is hosting them?,False
livelyMonkey: I don't understand why she couldn't do both though.,False
inspiredDolphin: Yea that is true but sometimes I don’t want to talk to my mother and I want to ask my husband things so why can’t I talk in the language I want ton,False
eagerGorilla: They're both assholes for not accomodating everyone. Translate into both languages if needed.,False
lightZebra: She doesn't indicate she is even trying to compromise,False
"fulfilledCamel: Now that is a solution. In the presence of her Mother, English only, if they are on their own (bedroom) speak what you want.",False
delightedBison: OP could include her mother in the conversation by interpreting things for her.,False
"livelyMonkey: Yeah, I felt she needed to include her mother too but still don't feel that she was an asshole.",False
fulfilledCamel: He should learn better English too. Her Mom did not marry the German guy did she ?,False
inspiredDolphin: I get that too ,False
eagerGorilla: I was in the same situation with my first husband (they were all Japanese) and my siL would interpret everything for me.,False
inspiredDolphin: And German isn’t a hard language to learn ,False
fulfilledCamel: Do you speak Japanese now? Did you attempt to learn Japanese?,False
"fulfilledCamel: No, German is a romance language and is easy to learn.",False
livelyMonkey: Sometimes it is hard to learn a foreign language. I know I have always struggled with it.,False
"eagerGorilla: No, we broke up. I tried to learn Japanese, but it is hard.",False
delightedBison: I agree that OP is not the asshole.  There is no reason the mother cannot learn a little German if she wishes to be included in conversation that badly.,False
"fulfilledCamel: Well, you tried. The husband is half way there, he could give more effort to get proficient.",False
inspiredDolphin: I know some speak German I am German and it’s a awesome language ,False
livelyMonkey: The daughter does need to find a way that she can speak to them both but in this scenario I do not feel that she was an asshole.,False
"fulfilledCamel: But on the other hand, the MIL did not marry the German.",False
eagerGorilla: Speaking a language is the best way to learn it. The husband has a great opportunity to learn in a family setting.,False
"fulfilledCamel: Yes, I agree. ",False
lightZebra: I think Op is the asshole for not trying harder to accommodate her Mom in her own house,False
fulfilledCamel: I also think she is an ass for not letting her husband learn more,False
"novelGorilla: No, she is not the asshole. The son and partner are disrespecting her by speaking French in her home.",False
eagerZebra: When looking at the situation and seeing that the partner did know how to speak English but was choosing not to was the part that made me feel like they were being assholes.,False
delightedDolphin: Thought that OP was overreacting slightly,False
inquisitiveBear: I mean it was kinda mean they did that to her they are there for a week they could could teach her some ,False
fulfilledGiraffe: I think OP is an asshole; she should be more worried about making her son's husband feel comfortable than being included in a single conversation.,False
openCamel: I think the son is the asshole here. His husband is taking his cues from him. The polite thing to do is speak the language of your host (if you can) when around them. No one should feel excluded.,False
eagerZebra: So the mom is not the asshole.,False
"novelGorilla: She was not overreacting, she has every right to expect that the partner and son speak English in her home. The partner does speak English.",False
delightedDolphin: It seems like one conversation. He outright says they are being disrespectful which is not necessarily the case,False
inquisitiveBear: They could teach her a few works to speak in French also so she would know what they are saying ,False
"novelGorilla: No, no one should feel excluded, you are correct. They can speak French in the bedroom.",False
delightedDolphin: He could have made his discomfort known more tactfully,False
"openCamel: The mom should have pulled the son aside and talked to him individually, so the husband wouldn't be embarassed.  Her technique was heavy handed.",False
delightedDolphin: i agree,False
"novelGorilla: Yes, the son was being the asshole. The Mom did not deserve the disrespect in her own home.",False
inquisitiveBear: She should have done it separately instead in front of the husband ,False
eagerZebra: The son knew his partner knew how to speak English and the fact that they didn't was the problem.,False
novelGorilla: The Mom just said she wanted them to speak English. The partner needed to hear it too.,False
eagerZebra: There was nothing wrong with that since the partner did know how to speak English.,False
delightedDolphin: I just don't see how the son was necessarily being disrespectful. He is probably used to speaking to his sig o in French,False
"fulfilledGiraffe: It can be super difficult staying with in-laws anyways, but especially when they don't want you to be yourself. I wouldn't expect my husband to accommodate my mom, even while visiting her.",False
delightedDolphin: Not intentionally being disrespectful. He is not a mind reader,False
"fulfilledGiraffe: They are guests, shouldn't they be allowed to use whatever language makes them feel most comfortable? I think the mom is being selfish.",False
inquisitiveBear: The husband could just let the mom and son speak and learn a few words and then when he felt like he could talk he could ,False
"openCamel: agreed, fulfilledGiraffe",False
eagerZebra: Because they knew when they were talking she would not understand it and they both could have spoken in English. It said the partner knew how to speak English.,False
novelGorilla: The partner and the husband should have decided beforehand how to handle this situation. Speaking English in front of the Mom should have been their decision.,False
novelGorilla: They are her guests !,False
delightedDolphin: Op doesnt say this was happening the whole time. It's just one conversation,False
"openCamel: I feel like no one was a true asshole, they all were to blame a little.",False
fulfilledGiraffe: So OP shouldn't feel so disrespected if it was only the ONE time.,False
eagerZebra: And she felt excluded because they knew how to speak English.,False
"novelGorilla: I thought it was all the time. Maybe you are correct, they are all assholes.",False
novelGorilla: Speaking English would have been respectful to the Mother. They are staying for a week. She is the host.,False
"novelGorilla: You know she is cooking and making them comfortable, they should respect her.",False
eagerZebra: They should have spoken English since they both knew how to.,False
"novelGorilla: Yes, use the language of the household, or at least try.",False
openCamel: Always respect your host and speak their language if you can,False
lightHippo: This person isn’t an asshole but probably could learn tact.,False
novelBear: Agreed.,False
lightHippo: I think it’s fair she spoke up saying she felt left out and isolated. But maybe taking her son aside would be better.,False
"brightMonkey: I agree. I definitely don't think they're an asshole, but could learn how to say it in another way. It's not the partner's fault he doesn't speak English.",False
"delightedDolphin: I found that the son's bf was a guest in the home and should try to be more open in a different environment, especially in the home of another person",False
delightedDolphin: but could have used more tact i agree,False
inquisitiveGorilla: No! she should have just call her son and explain things to him,False
"novelBear: Yeah, wasn't very respectful of the son and partner to exclude her from the conversation.",False
brightMonkey: Taking the son aside would have been better.,False
openBison: the conversation wasn't necessary if they're speaking french,False
delightedDolphin: agree,False
lightHippo: I agree taking the son aside,False
"novelBear: Whether or not she should've been more tactful, we can all agree she wasn't the asshole right?",False
lightHippo: Yes,False
"delightedDolphin: I too agree with taking the son aside, but she was not the asshole",False
inquisitiveGorilla: taking to the son will be better knowing the husband cant speak much English ,False
lightHippo: I thought it said the husband could speak English ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: i wont blame the husband ,False
novelBear: it did,False
openBison: the situation get worse after an improper challenges,False
lightHippo: I don’t see how the mom saying something could be that bad unless her tone was inappropriate ,False
brightMonkey: So we agree she wasn't an asshole?,False
novelBear: yep,False
delightedDolphin: I would agree that she is not the asshole,False
inquisitiveGorilla: i'll agree to that ,False
openBison: mom is taking this as a serious case probably she might hate the son,False
inquisitiveGorilla: if the son could give a comment like that its inappropriate ,False
openBison: i agree to the son's view,False
inquisitiveGorilla: i also agree to the son's view ,False
"lightHippo: I think we all pretty much agree, she is not an asshole. Speaking up for yourself respectfully is okay.",False
openBison: this person is an asshole. yes she is,False
"delightedDolphin: agree, she is not",False
novelBear: Agreed.  It was inconsiderate of them as her guests to exclude her from the conversation.,False
inquisitiveGorilla: i think shes an asshole ,False
delightedDolphin: it is her home,False
"curiousHorse: I think the son's the asshole personally.  As a guest, he should respect the wishes of his mother.",False
eagerMonkey: I am on the fence here but I think asshole.,False
fulfilledElephant: I believe he is an asshole because his partner can speak English. ,False
eagerMonkey: She should respect her mother that is hosting her and her husband ,False
"inspiredDolphin: unlike the French citizen example before, the German citizen truly doesn't understand English",False
fulfilledElephant: He can speak English he just doesn't know some words. ,False
"lightCamel: shes not an asshole, she should talk to the husband to make use of the english language ",False
"curiousHorse: Yeah, he can speak it well enough that they should just speak English when around the mother.",False
"brightZebra: since the partner can speak English but misses some words, it safe to speak.",False
eagerMonkey: I think she should encourage the husband ,False
brightZebra: but wasn't necessary for the mom to called her daughter an asshole,False
eagerMonkey: But she’s with him a 100% do the tir,False
lightCamel: she should just encourage the guy,False
inspiredDolphin: I don't think it warrants being called an asshole,False
eagerMonkey: Time,False
"fulfilledElephant: Agreed. She should encourage him to speak English, at least while she is around. ",False
brightZebra: everyone have the right to their choice and shouldnybe judge.,False
eagerMonkey: I think it’s fair for the mom to speak up,False
curiousHorse: not when you're someone's guest in their house,False
curiousHorse: anyway my vote's on son's an asshole,False
lightCamel: it okay she speaks up,False
lightCamel: the husband is the asshole not the lady,False
eagerMonkey: I think the husband should practice in a safe environment ,False
inspiredDolphin: I do see your point,False
fulfilledElephant: So can we agree the son is the asshole?,False
"curiousHorse: just so we're clear so we know who's being talked about, it was a gay male couple and a mother for the record.  so only she involved is the mom....we're agreeing it was the son?",False
lightCamel: the husband needs to be encouraged ,False
curiousHorse: yeah for sure,False
lightCamel: but in a polite manner ,False
"brightZebra: considering both sides, the month was actually annoyed and believe her daughter should've forced the husband to be speaking English. ",False

novelHippo: ok,False

"brightGiraffe: I agree. He isn't the asshole. He is trying to be helpful. He could have been a little more polite, but overall he's fine. ",False

openCamel: I can see where the mom is coming from-she hasn't seen her son and wants to be part of his life.,False
curiousZebra: I think the best way that his husband could get more comfortable with English would be to use this time to speak it with the family.,False
inspiredGiraffe: Me too but I think he’s the asshole.,False
brightOtter: I think she could find a way to bridge the gap between her mom and husband so they both felt included.,False
"fulfilledMonkey: I agree^ especially because the mom is being so gracious to house them and feed them, wanting to have a conversation isn't a crazy demand",False
"openCamel: I agree, some patient conversation among all parties would be helpful.",False
inspiredGiraffe: He could have translated for the mom,False
livelyGorilla: Exactly,False
"curiousZebra: Being anywhere and not feeling comfortable in the language of that country is hard, so I feel for the husband.",False
"novelElephant: I kind of agree. However, I think if the author is staying at his mom’s house, he should at least have the decency to include her in the conversation.",False
"eagerHippo: I feel like the poster here is being a bit of an asshole.  If his husband doesn't feel comfortable with english, but poster is comfy with both then poster should translate for his mother.",False
"openCamel: It is hard for both the mom and the husband-either way, one of them feels left out.",False
"curiousZebra: But mom deserves to be part of the conversation, especially since she's being so kind in hosting them.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: the husband does know english though, and the husband should want to use this time to get closer to his MIL i feel",False
inspiredGiraffe: Then everyone could have participated If they just had sometranslation,False
curiousZebra: Exactly what inspiredGiraffe said,False
novelElephant: Author needs to stop making it about “sides” and just translate for everyone. ,False
livelyGorilla: I agree,False
"eagerHippo: Yeah, like the husband could speak english until he doesn't know the right word and use the german one, poster can translate that for mother.",False
inspiredGiraffe: Agreed. Sides never work out well in family,False
brightOtter: The wife should have compromised to make both feel comfortable. Translating or helping husband with unknown words.,False
openCamel: I agree-author could bridge the gap between everyone.,False
fulfilledMonkey: OP could also definitely encourage the husband to try to practice more and say that his mom wouldn't judge him or etc,False
curiousZebra: Better to ask questions if a misunderstanding comes up than to leave someone out of the conversation completely.,False
eagerHippo: exactly,False
openCamel: It's a lot about respect.,False
"inspiredGiraffe: Agree,zebra",False
"novelElephant: Agreed, curiousZebra",False
curiousZebra: Good point openCamel,False
"openCamel: If they really cared about each other, they would be patient and understanding.",False
openCamel: Just ask questions and make it clear that no one is going to judge anyone for misunderstandings.,False
fulfilledMonkey: maybe OP could teach the mom a few common german greetings/sayings so husband could feel more welcomed and in return he'd be more willing to speak english,False
"curiousZebra: Exactly.  And it isn't stated, but I have a feeling that is why mom thinks her son is being an asshole right now",False
novelElephant: I would have the same feelings if I were the mom,False
openCamel: OP is def. in the position to make the most change.,False
inspiredGiraffe: I agree. No judgements necessary. They can find a common ground if the son could act as a bridge,False
eagerHippo: so would I.,False
"openCamel: I think if we agree OP has the ability to bridge the communication gap, he should. That would make him the ass if he isn't.",False
curiousZebra: Exactly,False
openCamel: *doesn't,False
eagerHippo: precisely how I feel,False
curiousGiraffe: I don't feel like the poster is an asshole,False
inquisitiveElephant: I feel like the author is not the asshole here.  I do think it's a big deal to exclude someone from the conversation in their own home.,False
brightCamel: I don't think mom is the ass.,False
fulfilledHorse: My initial impression I’d she’s a little bit of an asshol,False
openBison: I think the son is the asshole here... OP was just wanted to be included in a conversation that was being had while she was in the room.,False
fulfilledHorse: I just think she could have phrased her objection a little differently ,False
excitedOtter: yea i mean maybe she could have privately said something to OP,False
brightCamel: Son can speak both languages-he should bridge the communication gap.,False
delightedHippo: I do think the mom could have approached it better. ,False
fulfilledHorse: Maybe she could have asked to be includes,False
"lightBear: I also don’t feel like the poster is an asshole. He seemingly made his feelings aware in a polite way, and the son just went off the deep end",False
fulfilledHorse: Or asked for her son to translate ,False
excitedOtter: i get that the partner may have felt awkward / like OP was blaming them,False
"inquisitiveElephant: Yeah, the author is slightly an asshole, but I think the son telling her it's no big deal puts him more into that camp than the author.",False
"openBison: I mean, maybe the phrasing could be different, but I don't OP is an asshole for it.",False
excitedOtter: but i don't think her request was unreasonable,False
excitedOtter: yea i agree,False
"inquisitiveElephant: it wasn't, the phrasing may have been.",False
"brightCamel: Yeah, it could have been handled differently, but I agree with OP.",False
openBison: Everyone in the room speaks English.  Son could have translated if there was an issue in understanding.,False
inquisitiveElephant: precisely,False
fulfilledHorse: Agreed the son is the bigger asshole but I think when she led with them being disrespectful it was never going to end well,False
"curiousGiraffe: I feel like it is just polite, in a small group like this, to make sure that everyone in the room can be included",False
"inquisitiveElephant: Yeah, you can't exactly slap people in the face verbally with stuff like that.",False
curiousGiraffe: Kind of common sense,False
"openBison: Agreed, fulfilledHorse",False
inquisitiveElephant: There's a way to handle it.,False
lightBear: Totally true about the mom,False
"brightCamel: It does have a lot to do with respect. If they could all have a civil conversation, I think it would be easy enough to resolve.",False
delightedHippo: I agree with brightCamel ,False
"fulfilledHorse: Agreed, brightCamel",False
inquisitiveElephant: agreed,False
"excitedOtter: that's true, usually when people feel like they're being attacked, their knee jerk reaction is to go on the defense",False
"brightCamel: They're all asses ;), but it is OP's house, and the greater responsibility lies w/son who has the most power to help in the situation.",False
openBison: I honestly don't have much of an issue with how OP handled it..... She was asking to be included. ,False
inquisitiveElephant: and that's a hard response habit to break too,False
fulfilledHorse: So they all suck ,False
inquisitiveElephant: fulfilledHorse kind of,False
fulfilledHorse: Especially the son,False
lightBear: The son sounds immature ,False
"curiousGiraffe: So, the question is, if we *have* to pick 1 asshole, who is the asshole?",False
openBison: the son,False
inquisitiveElephant: the son,False
excitedOtter: the son,False
lightBear: Son,False
brightCamel: son,False
fulfilledHorse: Son,False

lightBison: She is not an asshole ,False
eagerGiraffe: I think she is the asshole,False
inspiredBear: This person is the asshole.,False
novelMonkey: it's stated in the article she asked politely ,False
"fulfilledCamel: There are so many players involved in that scenario, I believe I answered incorrectly.  I think the bratty 20 year old is an ass not the mother/father in this situation.",False
"inspiredBear:  Speaking in another tongue isn't disrespectful, and she didn't ask, she told. ",False
brightDolphin: I understand her frustration. But all she says about her son's husband is that he can speak French.,False
novelMonkey: he can speak english too,False
brightDolphin: It may be very difficult for him to speak Enlish.,False
"inspiredBear: Yes, but from the sounds of it, with him speaking little English while he is there, he might not be fluent. ",False
lightBison: The visiting husband is disrespectful by walking away just because the host asked to be included in their conversation.,False
eagerGiraffe: She said he speaks can English but she doesn't say how fluent he is.,False
"fulfilledCamel: The disrespect is that they were in her home, and she felt disrespected and excluded. ",False
openOtter: I realize that anyone who says the truth but English is hard to speak because most French speakers were never explained that English is 2 languages and she can't be blame because she feel left out i think,False
"excitedHorse: My impression is is that when in a group, group inherently has a conscensus to communicate with eachother and if the majority speak in english, there you go.  ",False
novelMonkey: i dont think she is at fault here,False
"inspiredBear: She may have felt left out, but she didn't need to call it out and make everyone in the room uncomfortable. ",False
novelMonkey: yh you right ,False
eagerGiraffe: I think a polite request would be to talk to her son in private rather than confront her son's partner.,False
"brightDolphin: She should have spoken with her son privately about the issue, rather than interrupting their conversation. Again, it may be very challenging for him to speak English conversationally.",False
lightBison: He does not need to be fluent to speak. the mother says he just got an accent. He should have made an effort.,False
novelMonkey: calling it out is wrong ,False
"excitedHorse: Personally, I would think it appropriate to say 'you ok with english'?  ",False
novelMonkey: she should have just called her son and tell him,False
"inspiredBear: I agree, speaking to the son privately instead of making it a uncomfortable situation for everyone would have been better",False
novelMonkey: yh,False
"excitedHorse: Or, 'wish I knew another language' and eased into 'you ok with english' type thing.",False
novelMonkey: i'll agree to that ,False
"inspiredBear: I don't think saying' you okay with English' is a good idea either, that could definitely be seen as disrespectful. ",False
inspiredBear: Easing into it might be better,False
"openOtter: as for me, i don't think she is trying to impose their language on him but she just wanted to know what they are up too and that's it",False
novelMonkey: guess shes wrong then,False
openOtter: she is right to say that ,False
"lightBison: In case the son wanted to speak something that needed privacy, they should speak of it in private",False
"excitedHorse: To speaking to son before group setting, I agree.  Like when travel arrangements were made, Mom could have covered the subject then.",False
novelMonkey: she should have just called her son and tell him,False
lightBison: i think she is not an asshole,False
"fulfilledCamel: My house, My rules! ",False
novelMonkey: sure,False
brightDolphin: I still consider her to be the asshole because of how she handled the situation.,False
inspiredBear: I agree,False
fulfilledCamel: I don't this she is the asshole. ,False
novelMonkey: she should have just called her son and tell him,False
excitedHorse: I think 'asshole' in any sense is kind of harsh here.  Especially with different cultures in a room.,False
curiousDolphin: I think that this person is the asshole ,False
fulfilledMonkey: me too,False
eagerBison: i think shes not an asshole ,False
"fulfilledMonkey: you come to your moms house, and don't include her in conversation! Rude!",False
inspiredHippo: That person is an asshole.,False
eagerBison: you think?,False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: I also think 'asshole'.  Pretty sure Mom would have understood her SIL had he tried, no matter, to get through an english sentence.",False
fulfilledMonkey: right!,False
inquisitiveGiraffe: It would be different were they at a hotel with non-family.  ,False
novelElephant: i think she is the asshole because her mother feel intimidated because she don’t understand anything and she look strange to her since it been long you are away from her,False
"curiousDolphin: While that might not be true, this seems to be a case where it's more than one conversation where she has been in the room, and she's not been included. ",False
eagerBison: guess you guys change my opinion ,False
"fulfilledMonkey: yes, have those conversations privately but include everyone when in Mixed language company",False
novelElephant: she is not able to say anything she want to hear or understand and makes her feel isolated from others ,False
novelElephant: she is the real asshole ,False
curiousDolphin: They have specifically stated that they aren't including her in  conversations for the majority of the weekend. ,False
inspiredHippo: She should have balanced and maybe told the husband to try speak  in a common language,False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: Mom may not even be the paranoid type, but even I would take notice if I left the room and heard sentences I couldn't understand.  ",False
eagerBison: to me i'll would have say the husband is at fault ,False
curiousDolphin: Balancing the languages here would be much better. ,False
eagerBison: why wont he speak english since he can speak,False
fulfilledMonkey: ever sat in a nail salon?? ,False
curiousDolphin: I'd actually disagree with that ,False
eagerBison: why hes he shy,False
"inspiredHippo: If they needed time alone to speak to themselves, they should have stayed in a hotel.",False
curiousDolphin: Because he doesn't speak it properly ,False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: If I were the Mom, I would have tried to use humor and encourage the husband to practice the language where there's a soft place to land if he makes a mistake.",False
curiousDolphin: I agree with that ,False
eagerBison: the wife should have just encourage the husband to speak and save herself the stress,False
novelElephant: she did not give her mother the confidence to understand if she speak different language regardless of only including her during the weekend,False
"lightBear: I don't think he's an asshole, he should definitely talk to his mom and explain, but making sure you're husband is comfortable doesn't make you an asshole.",False
eagerBison: you right ,False
inspiredHippo: At least he understands English and could have followed the conversation if the wife and her mother used English.,False
eagerBison: i agree with lightBear,False
curiousDolphin: I think there should have been a balance of languages used. ,False
eagerBison: yes ,False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: The husband could also have tried to let the spouse know that Mom is okay with butchered english.  The son could have translated, even if it meant a conversation takes longer.",False
novelElephant: i strongly agree lightBear,False
"curiousDolphin: Enough to make the husband comfortable, and enough to make the mother feel included ",False

curiousHippo: yes,False
"brightCamel: But considering the situation, I think she's not an asshole",False
curiousHippo: yes,False
lightOtter: I don't think it's fair for him to be spending time everyday when they have lived there for so long and Google translate exists,False
livelyZebra: i think she is,False
curiousHippo: of course you are right,False
eagerGiraffe: lmao i don’t think the parents are assholes,False
curiousHippo: ok,False
eagerGiraffe: i do agree that the husband shouldn’t have to translate whenever it’s convenient for them,False
"inquisitiveHorse: she is not an asshole ,her parent needs to learn english",False
lightOtter: I live in Miami and I get annoyed all the time at the millions of people that didn't bother to learn English (hispanic myself),False
eagerGiraffe: i think she was feeling entitled though,False
curiousHippo: yes,False
inquisitiveHorse: yes,False
"brightCamel: Yes, I believe it will affect the husband. But it was't her fault",False
inquisitiveHorse: true,False
curiousHippo: yes i also believe it,False
"eagerGiraffe: like if it’s that important to her, she should do it herself🤗",False
curiousHippo: yes very important to her,False
lightOtter: Yeah. At least she should do it herself sometimes,False
"brightCamel: Well, what did we agreed on then?",False
curiousHippo: well,False
inquisitiveHorse: she is not an asshoe,False
livelyZebra: well what ya'll suggest is nice,False
lightOtter: I vote she is,False

inquisitiveOtter: Hi,False
fulfilledZebra: hi,False
eagerBison: hai every one,False
excitedMonkey: hey,False
eagerBison: hi,False
eagerBison: discuss the material,False
excitedMonkey: I think he isn't the asshole because he has already tried to help the parents and offered to help them learn English,False
"inquisitiveOtter: We all have to agree on something, and to me this guy is not an asshole",False
excitedMonkey: Teach a man to fish and all that,False
eagerBison: i think she learn the english,False
"lightElephant: I don’t think he’s the asshole, I understand why he would be frustrated.",False
"fulfilledZebra: the husband has a point,they should not have to stress him each time they need to translate.he should have his freedom ",False
inquisitiveOtter: The only problem he caused himself is the way he related that issue. It seems annoying,False
eagerBison: yes,False
excitedMonkey: Yeah that could've been an issue but he was probably frustrated after the billionth call,False
"lightElephant: He expressed himself in ways that aren’t exactly agreeable (to me) like “it’s been 8 years, etc.” so what... help or don’t.",False
eagerBison: yes,False
excitedMonkey: He mentioned in the edit he said it in a more respectful way though,False
novelGorilla: The only problem he caused himself is the way he related that issue. It seems annoying,False
eagerBison: yes,False
inquisitiveOtter: Is there anyone that thinks he's an asshole or we all agree he's not?,False
"fulfilledZebra: it's not bad to advice them to learn english,he wont always be there for them.",False
eagerBison: yes,False
fulfilledZebra: i agree,False

inquisitiveOtter: Good,False
novelGorilla: yeah,False

eagerBison: yeah,False
eagerBison: not asshole,False
fulfilledZebra: expand and vte,False
inquisitiveOtter: He is not an asshole to advice her to learn English and also helps her with one way or other,False
eagerBison: i agree,False
delightedGorilla: My initial impression is that this guy is TA. I don't see how he can justify not speaking English when he is visiting his mother. He is around his husband 24/7 but he only visits his mother every so often. ,False
"delightedGorilla: However, I see how he would not want to make his husband uncomfortable or make him feel like he has to speak English if he is not comfortable doing so. ",False
"delightedGorilla: My thought is that the husband does not have to participate in conversation with they are speaking English unless he wants to, but that when the mom is out of the room, they can just speak German. ",False
"livelyElephant: Completely agree.  If you are going to live with your mother at her own gesture, she should be included in the conversation.  The german has the ability to speak English, so there's really no reasoning for it.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: I agree, in that I think he is TA. I think, his mother was kind enough to host them. I think as a sign of appreciation he should also make her feel comfortable.",False
"inspiredHippo: My initial impression is that while it's good to make his husband feel comfortable by speaking German only, his husband said he only has trouble speaking English (finding the right words). ",False
"delightedGorilla: Right, he should at least be able to understand English and chime in if he really wants to",False
livelyElephant: Correct! Only has some trouble speaking it - not that he can't speak it.  ,False
inspiredHippo: The German husband doesn't have to speak. He can listen/understand English while the American speaks to both of them (mom and hubby).,False
"lightHorse: I don't think the person IS ASSHOLE simply because she is speaking German with her husband. Her mother may feel indignant or left out by this discourse, but this reminds me that she is simply providing language accommodations.",False
"lightHorse: This should be an argument between her husband and her mother, why is her mother not talking with her husband?",False
brightBison: I too think he's being an asshole. There should be some time when English can be spoken. It's like being around people who are whispering...it is just rude.,False
delightedGorilla: And his mom is being accomodating to both of them and I'm sure she wants to be able to visit with and spend time with her son,False
inquisitiveZebra: I won't call the lady the asshole because she was only trying to impress her husband and make him feel comfortable. ,False
fulfilledMonkey: I think it's unfortunate that it was a missed opportunity for her husband and mother to get to know each other better. And he could have been the bridge to help them both. ,False
"fulfilledMonkey:  I think, people appreciate the effort, even if your language skills are bad.",False
"delightedGorilla: Yes I would definitely call the speaker the AH, not the mother",False
lightHorse: I considered both sides and find there not to be an asshole here. This could be resolved outside of reddit with a satisfactory conclusion between the three.,False
"inquisitiveZebra: But the husband on the other part being able to speak English even though not perfectly, should have considered the fact that they were only going to be at the mum's place just for the weekend.",False
"brightBison: As a mom though, I would ask them to speak English and explain why. Open communication can solve this.",False
livelyElephant: Agreed! The mother doesn't know German - only the husband and wife.  They call all speak English and her mother wants to be involved.,False
delightedGorilla: ligh,False
brightBison: They are close enough to stay with each other I would think they are close enough to talk this through.,False
delightedGorilla: lightHorse I think we have to come to a decision of YTA or NTA,False
"inquisitiveZebra: So to be honest, they should have all spoken English.",False
livelyElephant: YTA,False
"delightedGorilla: I agree, YTA",False
inspiredHippo: YTA,False
brightBison: Agreed,False
"lightHorse: OK, I'll agree.",False
"inspiredHippo: Also, the more he speaks English, the more he can learn/become more confident. Come out of your shell, shy turtle.",False
fulfilledMonkey: LOL ,False
"delightedGorilla: Exactly, especially if they're living in America half the time",False
livelyElephant: Hillarious!!!!,False
"inspiredHippo: Especially in the company of your husband's mom, someone who will care about you as opposed to randoms",False
brightBison: One says you can learn a language better when actually using it. This could have been presented as an opportunity for the husband to learn and the 3 of them have fun in the process!!,False
inspiredHippo: That's true. ,False
"delightedCamel: While I understand being self-conscious about an accent, if the son's partner speaks and understands English very well, he should be able to respect the mom enough to speak English in her home. ",False
"delightedCamel: This is very different from being in public (where everyone is welcome and, assuming a store, your money is doing all the talking). This is a family issue and a home where you are a guest. ",False
"inquisitiveOtter: I agree, my initial impression is that the mom is NTA and she was valid in what she said to them",False
"inspiredGorilla: I agree, the son should be kind to his mother she will do everything for him. This is not very nice.",False
livelyBear: I dont think she was being an TA. I think she went about it in the wrong way.,False
"novelHorse: Agreed - should speak English.  If they all can speak English (and he is just shy of it), it would be more beneficial for him to speak English.",False
"inquisitiveOtter: I think she was right in saying it was disrespectful, it's almost like them texting each other while she's in the room",False
"delightedCamel: In a store, you're a paying customer, not simply a guest of a loved one's hospitality. Very different. I think the son's the asshole, not the mom. ",False
"inquisitiveOtter: Idk if it even said he was shy about it, just that he has an accent, which is fine",False
"brightHippo: that was an interesting situation. i know we need to take what the OP has at face vaIlue but, she emphaiszed",False
brightHippo: I stopped them and nicely told them that I find it disrespectful that they’re speaking language I don’t understand and excluding me from conversation.,False
eagerElephant: Please let's take into consideration that she said she stopped them NICELY. ,False
"delightedCamel: True, only that he had an accent.",False
brightHippo: the word nicely and disrepectful,False
brightHippo: i think maybe either something got lost in translation or intent,False
novelHorse: Good analogy. Having three people in the room and and two texting is disrespectful.  The same applies here.,False
"eagerElephant: Yes, i agree with  brightHippo",False
inquisitiveOtter: Sometimes people don't like being called out for things but that doens't mean they're in the right,False
"delightedCamel: She did ask nicely, true. I do not think something got lost in the her meaning. I think the French partner simply took offense of his own will. Why, I don't know.",False
"delightedCamel: That's true, inquisitiveOtter",False
inspiredGorilla: I agree with delightedCamel,False
"novelHorse: At this point, I am in favor of NTA",False
eagerElephant: She only pointed out her worries and she did that nicely.,False
delightedCamel: NTA,False
eagerElephant: NTA,False
inquisitiveOtter: If you're with a group of people it would make sense to speak a language they all can understand,False
"livelyBear: I gree with bH. The men could have been offended by the ""disrespectful"" term. I feel she could have come out with ""hey guys..do you think you could speak in English? I would love to hear what you are talking about!""",False
inquisitiveOtter: Yes she could have worded it more nicely but she was saying how she felt,False
delightedCamel: That's a good point. Maybe it was the word disrespectful. That carries a connotation that it's deliberate. It's also something elders tend to wield like a cudgel when they need to and that can rub one wrong.,False
"livelyBear: Granted there may be some times when it's not possible, but they are family...it should be inclusive on all their parts.",False
"delightedCamel: True, livelyBear",False
inquisitiveOtter: I want to say NTa,False
novelHorse: Concur - NTA,False
livelyBear: I sat NTA,False
livelyBear: say,False
inspiredGorilla: I sat NTA.,False
livelyBear: Hopefully they can all come back together after a break and talk it through to enjoy the rest of the visit.,False
delightedCamel: Aye.,False
inspiredDolphin: So what do you guys think?,False
delightedZebra: I thing that the guy is sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please two different people.,False
inspiredDolphin: I think she's in the wrong here,False
excitedElephant: The mans mom was nice enough to make them comfortable in her house his husband and himself should have been nice enough back to talk in English and include her. ,False
delightedZebra: I feel like the mom and husband need to figure out some sort of compromise.,False
fulfilledMonkey: I think the girl and mother are hosts herald should be considerate to the guy,False
inspiredDolphin: true exactly. Also he speaks English whereas the mom doesn't know any German at all,False
lightCamel: Yeah I'd say he's in the wrong. At least his husband can speak SOME english.,False
"openBison: I understand the complexity of the situation. Isolating a host that is giving you food, shelter, and is your mum makes me believe she is in the wrong.",False
inspiredDolphin: Exactly,False
inspiredDolphin: I agree,False
brightBear: I agree as well,False
fulfilledMonkey: The mom should be more understanding of the situation,False
"delightedZebra: Ya, it is kind of sh^^ty to exclude the mom",False
openBison: It is possible to combined the language usage. ,False
excitedElephant: I do have 1 question. Was the men at least translating for his mom? If not that is rude,False
"inspiredDolphin: Yeah, she can just help the husband if he has trouble",False
"delightedZebra: Ya, mom can learn a bit of german and husband can try his american more.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: The guy is new to the place and language , whereas Mom is comfortable in her own backyard",False
excitedElephant: Right. Plus the are married they need to get to know each other. ,False
lightCamel: I mean it's true the mother could be more understanding but she's not wrong.,False
openBison: I did not get the impression that the mum was clued in on any discussion. ,False
excitedElephant: I didn't either. Meaning that didn't even make an effort to include her. ,False
delightedZebra: I don't think they translated for mom - they should,False
openBison: It was behavior that excluded whether it meant to or not. ,False
excitedElephant: That is why I believe he is the A hole here. ,False
fulfilledMonkey: I think the mom can be made to understand the situation and am sure there would be a lot of instances when the daughter -mom could catch up in private too.,False
"lightCamel: I deal with this kind of stuff on a weekly basis with my own mother so I can tell you, it makes her feel bad as well.",False
"delightedZebra: Maybe it's 30% mom's fault, 70% husband's fault?",False
inspiredDolphin: The question is if the wife is the asshole,False
inspiredDolphin: not the husband,False
lightCamel: That's a good way to put it I suppose.,False
delightedZebra: I get left out of my husband's family discussions sometimes - it sucks,False
excitedElephant: I understand both sides. ,False
brightBear: I think this person is a hole because he should have been more respectful towards his mom,False
"openBison: If you are hosting some one spending time, money, and the like that is very inconsiderate. It could be a comprise of english and german. I do it all the time with my French friends. ",False
"fulfilledMonkey: The wife is not a A . Since she tried to make the right person moree comfortable-  her husband- who needed it in a new land ,not speaking the language.",False
delightedZebra: It's two men that are married. There's no wife...,False
lightCamel: It's two males,False
excitedGorilla: The son is the asshole here for sure,False
livelyGiraffe: I think they should speak in English in respect to their hostess,False
lightMonkey: Mom just wanted to eb included. ,False
curiousCamel: I would side with the mother but she probably did handle it the wrong way.,False
delightedBear: This is a challenging case. I do not prefer how the mum handled it. ,False
excitedGorilla: The mom asked nicely it says,False
excitedGorilla: and the son's husband speaks english too,False
"inspiredHippo: Yes, the mom did ask nicely. ",False
"livelyGiraffe: Ya, it said mom was respectful when she said how she felt",False
"brightDolphin: Mom is an A. Agreed it was not appropriate for them not to be speaking in English when they could , but she should not have made an issue with a guest in her home",False
livelyGiraffe: The boyfriend seemed like the most jerk,False
excitedGorilla: son is clearly the ahole no doubt,False
inspiredHippo: Right! If he could speak English he should have so no one is left out.,False
"curiousCamel: Like, she was right but it's one of those things you don't really need to call someone out for on the spot.",False
lightMonkey: I agree the son was the a hole here. Mom just wanted to be included and as hosted I feel she had that right. ,False
excitedGorilla: exactly I agree,False
delightedBear: I do not believe the mum is in the wrong here. If the tables were reversed she may not get the time of day . ,False
inspiredHippo: She probably did not want the whole visit to be this way and that is why she brought it up,False
livelyGiraffe: I wonder why the bf was so disrespectful. seems weird to me. ,False
lightMonkey: I agree the boyfriend is the biggest a hole here. ,False
"curiousCamel: I don't know, leaves a bad impression for the mother.",False
livelyGiraffe: Leaves a terrible impression on the bf,False
curiousCamel: Makes you think she might be too uptight.,False
livelyGiraffe: oops - for the bf,False
inspiredHippo: I'm sure the partner would have felt the same if tabes were turned.,False
"brightDolphin: Sometimes , you want to converse about an issue ,in the language you are comfortable in … even though you know a bit of the other language.",False
excitedGorilla: Yeah they were both disrespectful to the mother who was the hostess,False
lightMonkey: She did say that he had hardly spoken in English. ,False
brightDolphin: Mom spoiled the mood of everyone,False
curiousCamel: Exactly.,False
excitedGorilla: She had the right to though,False
livelyGiraffe: the partner was sulky to just leave the room. rude!,False
lightMonkey: But mom just wanted to be included. ,False
"delightedBear: Language is precious reflects identity, but the boyfriend was so rude. He could speak to the mum but didn't much in English.",False
"excitedGorilla: the mom needed to be included, and it really wasn't that hard to do soo",False
"inspiredHippo: Was she supposed to deal with that, feeling left out the whole time instead of not saying anything?",False
excitedGorilla: exactly. Like thats her son,False
inspiredHippo: Maybe not the right time to discuss her feelings,False
livelyGiraffe: Maybe the partner was really nervous and shy or something??,False
lightMonkey: I feel she handled it ina okay way. ,False
"brightDolphin: Of course, ideally, English should have been spoken, but she didn't't have to create bad feelings unnecessarily.",False
"curiousCamel: Yeah but it seems like the bf didn't realize he was being rude, but probably felt embarrassed to be called out like that. ",False
"excitedGorilla: Eh, she asked nicely tho, its not like she threw a tantrum",False
livelyGiraffe: I'm glad she was honest.,False
delightedBear: I agree the how maybe was not executed correctly by the mum.,False
"delightedBear: But she was sincere, so I can't fault her.",False
excitedGorilla: exactly she was honest. Its the son/boyfriends fault for throwing off the vibe,False
livelyGiraffe: Partner needs to bring her flowers and apologize. And thank his hostess,False
excitedGorilla: exactly,False
inspiredHippo: I agree - that would have been the right thing to do,False
"brightDolphin: If she had not called them out, it would have stayed a good atmosphere…. she was the one to have been more mature in this situation",False
lightMonkey: I guess my thing is when I stay with someone else I do things with them not leave them out. ,False
"livelyGiraffe: Like, who wouldn't want to make a good impression on your SO's parents?",False
delightedBear: brightDolphin if it were me I would learned some french to ask please include me I don't understand. ,False
lightMonkey: I just feel that by the boyfriend not speaking to her made it okay for her to ask to be included. ,False
inspiredHippo: Lol - I love it!,False
livelyGiraffe: The son needed to talk to his partner and tell him to show respect for his mom,False
brightDolphin: there is something called being a nice host… calling your guest out for a small matter… doesn't reflect that. Mom iis A,False
curiousCamel: I forgot to vote last time...,False
inspiredHippo: He shouldn't have to be told - but some people are self centered,False
excitedGorilla: bruhhh lol,False
openZebra: Hi all,False
delightedBear: hey,False
livelyGorilla: Hi! I really didn't think anyone the asshole. They just have different opinions about their obligations to this family.,True
eagerDolphin: hi,False
novelElephant: hi.  ,False
"openZebra: yeah, i felt that way too",False
lightGiraffe: Yea the person writing was not an asshole.,False
"openZebra: if i had to answer I'd say No, but it sounds like they need to have better communication, and maybe set up a better system",False
novelElephant: I agree.  It's reasonable for the person with more free time currently to take on the small extra task of helping out.,False
"delightedBear: Yeah, I can agree with that. I think that the husband could very easily convey his feelings to the mom though. Like he could just help her learn how to figure stuff out on her own by showing her duolingo or rosetta stone and how to use them",False
openZebra: Yeah good point,False
novelElephant: Having the mom go straight to the husband maybe not helping in their communications,False
"eagerDolphin: I kind of agree with livelyGorilla but would word it more like they're both being kind of assholes lol. She shouldn't ""expect"" him to do these things just because he has more time. But his reasoning and response is really assholish. ",False
novelElephant: They could work together better as a team certainly,False
lightGiraffe: Communication would be key.,False
eagerDolphin: Exactly. ,False
livelyGorilla: I agree novelElephant,True
openZebra: Totally,False
excitedHorse: Hi! I agree. They could work together.,False
"eagerDolphin: but, since I think we have to choose either is or isn't the asshole I would say she is the asshole. But I mean, I understand her position. ",False
lightGiraffe: It does seem like if i had to pin asshole on either one of them thought it would be the husband.,False
novelElephant: it is tough to decide degree of assholishness to each,False
"openZebra: yeah, he definitely said some stupid things",False
livelyGorilla: I agree I think the husband's reaction was asshole-like.,True
openZebra: It's funny though because we can',False
delightedBear: Yeah I think husband too. He's being unreasonable and the mother only calls because he was obviously willing to help at one point,False
openZebra: Can't really judge him,False
novelElephant: it would be nice if she were more appreciative of the help husband was giving,False
novelElephant: maybe her role in being the asshole is the expectation that of course he'll do it ,False
"openZebra: Yeah, her tone was like she was on the attack from the get-go",False
eagerDolphin: I don't think the husband is being an asshole just for setting that boundary though. I think how he defined the boundary was assholish. But not the fact that he did. If that makes any sense. ,False
openZebra: Totally agree eagerDolphin,False
lightGiraffe: At any rate someone has to be the asshole,False
"livelyGorilla: I think she should be kinder and more understanding of how stressful it can be to help. I think she should ask rather than order. But, I think that maybe he should react in a better way especially to his in-laws.",True
"delightedBear: yeah that makes sense, eagerDolphin I agree with that",False
novelElephant: and same on her end - reasonable to expect help but could go about it in a more respectful way,False
eagerDolphin: I think the wife is the asshole for basically expecting her husband to be a translator when he is obviously annoyed by it. ,False
novelElephant: sounds like we think she is the asshole then?,False
excitedHorse: I agree.,False
lightGiraffe: im ok with it,False
delightedBear: a mild asshole lol,False
"openZebra: I think so too, that she is the asshole here. Even if they have work to do on their communication, with the evidence of her post alone, I feel pretty confident",False
"eagerDolphin: Ok. So it seems we generally agree. Both parties have a point and we can see where both are coming from.  But ultimately if one person gets the title, it's the wife?",False
brightGiraffe: Hey,False
novelHippo: hello,False
openElephant: hello,False
inquisitiveGorilla: hi there,False
eagerCamel: Hi,False
delightedHorse: hi,False
inspiredBear: ola,False
novelHippo: ola :),False
brightGiraffe: Any initial thoughts?,False
openElephant: I think he's the asshole,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: so, I feel like this guy is the asshole",False
inspiredBear: I agree on him being the asshole,False
delightedHorse: Definitely sounds like an asshole with his mindset,False
inspiredBear: Also does anyone else find this post familiar at all?,False
novelHippo: I agree.  It is harsh to tell others to just learn a language,False
brightGiraffe: I also thought he was an asshole for the way he treated the mom and his mindset since English really isn't a national language of the U.S.,False
openElephant: all of my posts have been about language barriers,False
eagerCamel: I understand that he is frustrated.,False
novelHippo: it can come easy for some but not for others,False
"delightedHorse: I kinda agree with him that she should be learning English, but it sounds like he went about it the complete wrong way",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: When he flaunts his own achievements, I think he also is taking for granted his mother-in-laws age and experience",False
brightGiraffe: Plus he sounded so arrogant when he said he learned languages in 2 years so why can't everyone else.,False
novelHippo: it might be ideal but not necessarily realistic,False
"openElephant: Also, like...why did you learn those languages just to like...not use them? Just so you can say you can speak them?",False
inspiredBear: I did not like the part about telling her to get her shit together.,False
brightGiraffe: English is not a national language of the U.S. It's not a necessity to be a citizen.,False
"brightGiraffe: Sure, it's useful but to tell someone off for not knowing English is wrong",False
novelHippo: it seemed like he changed his tune at the end of the story because he got backlash,False
"delightedHorse: but the vast majority speak English here, so in order to adequately communicate with the majority, you need to know English",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: Yeah, he has a very aggressive tone in the initial post",False
openElephant: He didn't help himself by outing himself as a trump supporter,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I feel like it speaks to his personality,False
"brightGiraffe: But, it's not a requirement. He was just incredibly rude in how he interacted with the mom.",False
eagerCamel: He said at the end of story that he was polite and spoke respectful tone?,False
"inspiredBear: I was trying to look at other sides but i say off with his head, hes the asshole",False
openElephant: He was aggressive in his post to complete strangers ,False
novelHippo: why not just help out the relatives and in the process help them learn a bit of english too without worrying about whether it'll be enough ,False
delightedHorse: oh I definitely agree that he was super rude. Should have gone about it completely differently,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I think it's good that he offered her tools like duolingo, but I feel like he probably didn't take the time to show her how they work",False
openElephant: I agree. I think it's great to share resources.  ,False
novelHippo: seems like greater patience would help,False
brightGiraffe: He just needs to go about it in a better way. And he needs to change his mindset about immigrants.,False
"openElephant: As someone who speaks multiple languages, I will just say that if I don't feel like translating for someone I just don't answer the phone from those people lol",False
"inquisitiveGorilla: I agree. He also married into the situation and it's weird, it's like he suddenly snapped",False
"openElephant: I look at it and I'm like ""nah, not right now"" and put the phone down and go about with my day",False
inquisitiveGorilla: good point openElephant lol,False
brightGiraffe: I also speak multiple languages but it's a different mindset you might have since the wife's a first gen.,False
novelHippo: he could be more helpful in helping the family members to help themselves,False
brightGiraffe: There's a sense of responsibility.,False
"eagerCamel: Yes, he should be more helpful.",False
novelHippo: there could be a component of stubbornness on the part of the family members,False
"brightGiraffe: He doesn't owe them anything, sure, but he married into this family and it's disrespectful to treat them the way he did. I just think he should offer to show them Duolingo etc in a kind manner.",False
novelHippo: but that doesn't mean he has to be so pushy,False
openElephant: Yeah. Which would warrant frustration. But this guy just unhinged. ,False
"inquisitiveGorilla: Since the task is really to judge from evidence in the post alone, especially it's tone and language used, I feel like he's definitely the asshole in this instance",False
"openElephant: So, it sounds like that we agree. He is the asshole. ",False
delightedHorse: Agreed 100%,False
novelHippo: Seems like this person is indeed an asshole who could be way more respectful in helping out his family members,False
inspiredBear: I am in agreeance that hes an asshole.,False
brightGiraffe: He is the asshole because of his treatment of the family and his tone.,False
eagerCamel: I agree,False
"delightedHorse: At best, he's just trying to hide that he's actually an asshole by all his ""politeness""",False
inquisitiveGorilla: True,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I agree,False
"openElephant: good point, delightedHorse",False
inspiredBear: maybe trying to get validation.,False
fulfilledMonkey: This guy is definitely the asshole. It's disrespectful to speak a language that your host doesn't know,False
"inspiredBear: So, personally, I thought this was a little muddled. However, I did think that for just a weekend -stay at the mother's the couple should try and speak a language all know",False
"novelHorse: I think this person is an asshole. Because he's at his mom's, who is the host. ",False
"fulfilledMonkey: Especially a family member, especially a mother.",False
"lightGiraffe: If they live part time in Germany, they can speak German while there.  His mother feels left out in the conversation.  She only gets the opportunity to see her son half the time. ",False
"novelHorse: Also, the partner knows English, even thought it's not good English. So, why not try to speak English for the weekend.",False
fulfilledMonkey: I agree with light lightGiraffe,False
lightGiraffe: I would fee like they were talking about me honestly.,False
"fulfilledMonkey: If the partner knows any English, they should speak English in the mother's home",False
"inspiredBear: right, plus the son can be an english dictionary if he does not know the correct word in English. If they live in europe, this can't be the first time they are in a situation where their language is a little iffy",False
novelHorse: lightGiraffe I agree because you don't know what they're saying.,False
"livelyHippo: I agree that the couple should try speaking English around the mother. However, if they are in private, them speaking German is okay.",False
"fulfilledMonkey: True, inspiredBear",False
lightGiraffe: No one thinks he's not an asshole?  ,False
"fulfilledMonkey: I considered both sides, but for me it's pretty clear cut. ",False
inspiredBear: livelyHippo thats a good point too,False
"fulfilledMonkey: it's a good point, but he's still the asshole.",False
inspiredBear: ya anyone think that person is NOT the asshole?,False
fulfilledMonkey: some people haven't voiced an opinion,False
fulfilledMonkey: but it looks like we agree,False
"novelHorse: They could be inactive. If not, they're probably agreeing he's an asshole like the rest of us.",False
livelyHippo: I originally thought he wasn't an asshole because I was curious about why the mom wasn't making an effort to learn any German. But after thinking about it I agree that it's the couple's responsibility and he's an asshole.,False
"fulfilledMonkey: Conclusion: If they're in the mother's home and she only speaks English, then not speaking English is rude and insensitive.",False
"inspiredBear: i think they were only visitng for a weekend anyways, you might learn ""hello"" in German but I don't think much else haha",False
inspiredBear: agreed,False
"fulfilledZebra: while I thouht the poster could have probably phrased the conversation better, I do agree that people should try and speak a language all know. especially when someone is hosting you.",False
inspiredBison: Seems like the other case.  He seems like a sensitive person to go upstairs and pout.  ,False
fulfilledZebra: so i do not think she was an asshole,False
"delightedCamel: I don't think this person is wrong or the asshole. Calling her son and his partner disrespectful might have been extreme, I agree with her",False
"inquisitiveHippo: I don't think the mom was an asshole. She asked nicely and explained it was disrespectful. Also, the husband knows English, so why couldn't he make an effort for his mother in law.",False
delightedCamel: She's allowed to express her feelings and her comfort level.,False
inquisitiveHippo: I also agree that he was very immature to go upstairs over this matter and for the son to be acting in this sense.,False
"brightGorilla: I say the parent is not the asshole. I do agree that saying they were ""disrespectful"" to their faces may have been the problem.",False
delightedCamel: Does anyone think she's the asshole?,False

"delightedCamel: agreed, inspiredBison",False
"brightGorilla: Yep, she's allowed to feel that way. And even more so to bring it up to them.",False
inspiredBison: The partner doesn't seem like he wants to become the hubby,False
"fulfilledZebra: inquisitiveHippo good point. Someone bringing up something that bothers them should not end up in a fit and that they are ""making a big deal out of nothing""",False
"delightedCamel: the only sticking point, I think, is her use of the word ""disrespectful"". Still, it doesn't make her an asshole.",False
"fulfilledZebra: Ya the post was brief so there is some level of ""how did she say it"".",False
brightGorilla: ^100% agree,False
"inquisitiveHippo: Yes, definitely.",False
"delightedCamel: for me, I always tried to please my mother in law, not to leave in a snit.",False
delightedCamel: so are we agreed that she's not the asshole?,False
inspiredBison: Exactly delightedCamel,False
inquisitiveHippo: Maybe it's different for him since he's French and they're ways of doing things are different?,False
fulfilledZebra: i vote - not an asshole,False
inspiredBison: Not here too,False
"inquisitiveHippo: Agreed, not an asshole.",False
brightGorilla: Not the asshole,False
delightedGiraffe: Conversations are capable of being had without someone.,False
"novelDolphin: Initially I felt like he may be the asshole, but I think ultimately he isn't.",False
"novelDolphin: I agree that conversations can be had without all participants, but they're guests in his home and everyone is sitting in a more intimate setting.",False
delightedGiraffe: I think the parent is slightly the asshole because they made the scenario about their insecurity.,False
openZebra: I dont think the person needed to be part of the conversation that was in French,False
inspiredGorilla: I don't think this person is the asshole. The son is being rude by not including her in the conversation when she's right there,False
delightedGiraffe: Nobody is entitled to be a part of a conversation.,False
"novelDolphin: I think he could have maybe presented it as ""I would like to be included in the conversation"".",False
fulfilledOtter: Initially I felt like they arent the asshole because the partner has been actively excluding them when they are a guest,False
delightedGiraffe: Learn French and be a part of the next conversation. ,False
novelDolphin: Calling them disrespectful closes the door to having an open conversation.,False
inspiredGorilla: That I agree with. Putting them on the defensive was the wrong move,False
"fulfilledOtter: Their outburst, though, was very rude to the son and their partner",False
"openZebra: I agree, calling them disrespecful is the wrong way to go about it",False
delightedGiraffe: I think the whole issue was blown out of proportion and that's what caused a problem.,False
novelDolphin: If they want to converse privately they should be conversing in a private space. Since they're in the intimate group setting it makes sense to speak a language that everyone understands.,False
"novelDolphin: I think so, too. It was definitely blown out of proportion. The approach was just super off.",False
"inspiredGorilla: Yes, I agree. No one looks good. ",False
fulfilledOtter: I wonder if they are overestimating how well he speaks english...,False
inspiredGorilla: But ultimately the kids shouldn't have been butthurt about it,False
"novelDolphin: Though it is uncomfortable, I don't think that the parent is an asshole.",False
novelDolphin: Maybe just needs more tact.,False
"delightedGiraffe: If the conversation is mutually between them, they can have it. Moving to a private space opens them to being questioned which may not be necessary.",False
delightedGiraffe: The parent is too sensitive in this scenario.,False
"novelDolphin: They're entitled to feel however they want about it, but I think some etiquette on both sides was necessary.",False
delightedGiraffe: I can agree with that.,False
"inspiredGorilla: Maybe too sensitive but I still think they can ask that ""hey, I'm right here, can we talk in a common language and not exclude me from the conversation?""",False
"novelDolphin: I think, ironically, the issue here is communication of feelings.",False
novelDolphin: Or lackthereof rather.,False
delightedGiraffe: That's true. It's hard to read minds and it seems that the parent wanted that.,False
novelDolphin: Perhaps even waiting for a pause in their conversation to introduce an open topic would be appropriate and a gentle steer back into a common language.,False
inspiredGorilla: Yeah. But I don't think the parent is an asshole,False
novelDolphin: I don't either.,False
"inspiredGorilla: Could have gone about it better, but it was a reasonable request",False
"fulfilledOtter: Agreed, but lack of tact doesnt mean asshole",False
novelDolphin: Exactly.,False
"delightedGiraffe: Not in a blatant, disrespectful way. Just in an overbearing way that negates responsibility to express emotions.",False
novelGiraffe: The OP is trying to keep the waters calm. I don't think they are the asshole.,False
curiousElephant: I think that she is the asshole even if she was just trying to make sure her husband felt comfortable.,False
"novelGiraffe: However, people-pleasing will give the you title of asshole.",False
"delightedDolphin: I think he is the asshole, for not being considerate of his parents when they are guests.  There are ways to balance keeping his husband comfortable and including his mom.",False
"livelyBison: I agree, I don't think the guy is the asshole",False
inspiredMonkey: I don't think they are either.,False
novelGiraffe: He can have a conversation with them individually.,False
inspiredMonkey: I'm sure when speaking English the other guy probably feels just as uncomfortable as a non-native speaker,False
curiousElephant: I think that OP could have spent time with their mother to ensure that they were able to have meaningful conversations.,False
novelGiraffe: To expect someone to speak a language they aren't confident with makes one an asshole.,False
livelyBison: I think the mother did very little to try to be part of the conversation and just demanded and gave a sob story about how much she felt left out. She acted immature,False
delightedDolphin: He can also translate for brief interactions.  It's entirely possible. ,False
novelGiraffe: I agree with the immaturity.,False
curiousElephant: I don't think there's enough data to suggest the mother gave a sob story or was immature.,False
"novelGiraffe: It may be possible, but that doesn't mean it's required.",False
"novelGiraffe: If it is required, the parent is the asshole.",False
curiousElephant: I think that empathy would have gone a long way here.,False
inspiredMonkey: I think he can have a conversation with both of them in their language and not be an asshole.,False
curiousElephant: Both from the parent and the child.,False
"curiousElephant: I think I can understand the mom feeling disappointed, but he was trying to walk a fine line.",False
delightedDolphin: He could speak to both of them and be tactful about it.  Why is one persons comfort so much more important than someone elses,False
inspiredMonkey: Yeah he was in a no-win situation.,False
novelGiraffe: The fact that this is an issue in the family dynamic makes the parent the asshole. It's not disrespectful to have a conversation with your significant other.,False
"livelyBison: He looked out for the feelings of his partner first, isn't that what a good spouse does? I don't think he was being the asshole",False
curiousElephant: I agree with speaking to both and having tact.,False
novelGiraffe: He was in a no-win situation.,False
"curiousElephant: I think even if he didn't mean to be, he was the asshole.",False
novelGiraffe: Can't please everyone.,False
"curiousElephant: If you please everyone, you lose.",False
"curiousElephant: try to please, rather.",False
inspiredMonkey: I disagree curiousElephant Was he supposed to make his spouse feel uncomfortable for the sake of his mother?,False
"curiousElephant: No, but he also wasn't supposed to be a guest in his mother's home and make her feel left out.",False
curiousElephant: Especially since his time is split between two countries.,False
delightedDolphin: You can't please everyone but that doesn't mean you have to exclude someone knowing it hurts them,False
livelyBison: Definitely should put the feelings of his spouse first,False
"novelGiraffe: I feel if you invite guests into your home, you accommodate them. Not the other way around.",False
curiousElephant: I can understand that viewpoint.,False
novelGiraffe: The mom made a bigger deal out of this than necessary.,False
inspiredMonkey: Yeah the guy was in a no-win situation. That doesn't make him an asshole for trying to make the best of it,False
delightedDolphin: inspiredMonkey I don't think he tried to make the best of it,False
"curiousElephant: By that logic, then no one was an asshole.",False
inspiredMonkey: There doesn't always have to be an asshole,False
curiousElephant: Agreed,False
"curiousElephant: Unfortunately, we still have to decide.",False
inspiredMonkey: The story didn't say that he refused to speak English to his mother did it?,False
"curiousElephant: No, just that he was uncomfortable using it. However, I don't think the mother had any way of knowing that unless her son communicated it.",False
"lightCamel: So, I personally think that it would not have been that difficult to include both the husband and the mother in the conversation.",False
livelyBison: I agree with that,False
openGorilla: I think it's rude to go to someone elses home and speak another language,False
livelyBison: Talk to the husband in German and then fill the mother in on what was said,False
curiousHorse: I somewhat agree in this seems to be a case where not enough effort is being put into reaching a compromise or a solution,False
lightCamel: I agree with livelyBison ,False
"delightedZebra: I agree, there are ways to include both the mother and husband. There are options such as google translate, etc",False
eagerDolphin: I agree openGorilla – I can't imagine going to my parents hous eand purposefully speaking so they can't undesrstand it.,False
"excitedHippo: I agree, even if the husband has trouble with choosing the right words in English he could still very well translate and include both in the conversation.",False
livelyBison: Agreed but i dont think that makes him an asshole,False
eagerDolphin: I wonder what language they speak with his German family.,False
"lightCamel: I don't think it's necessary rude to speak another language in their house, but I think it is rude to not include the mother at all.",False
lightCamel: necessarily*,False
"openGorilla: and the husband never said he didn't want to speak english, just that it makes him uncomfortable so she's a asshole in my opinion",False
lightCamel: I feel like she's not communicating enough with either of them,False
excitedHippo: I don't think he's an asshole but I do think there could have been some kind of compromise that would have worked out for everyone.,False
"brightBear: I think she should include both, maybe extra work on her part. Its out of respect for her mother and her house, but also include her husband.",False
"curiousHorse: I think it makes him an asshole, but not for the reason he thinks he might be an asshole- I sympathize with being caught in the middle but at the very least he could've sat his mom and his husband down and had them explain their feelings.",False
delightedZebra: yea she didn't put enough effort into including her mother even though she and her husband are guests,False
"eagerDolphin: I think she's TA especially because it seems like she and her husband don't visit all the time. It's like a somewhat special occassion, so of course the mother would want to talk with both of them a lot.",False
eagerDolphin: I have a hard time seeing the situation in a light in which the OP is not TA.,False
openGorilla: I can understand her wanting to make her new husband feel more comfortable but you have to be reasonable ,False
"lightCamel: Yeah, I agree. He should make an effort to fill in his mother on his life and make his husband feel comfortable at the same time.",False
livelyBison: I agree eagerDolphin and openGorilla,False
"curiousHorse: Honestly I kind of feel like the bigger asshole is the husband for not getting over himself and accept sometimes words will fail him, but the OP is at least An Asshole if not The Asshole",False
"lightCamel: So, how many of us think he's TA and how many of us think he's NTA? ",False
eagerDolphin: TA,False
openGorilla: nta,False
lightCamel: TA,False
curiousHorse: TA,False
livelyBison: Yeah i agree with that too. That’s the husbands family now too so he should make an effort,False
brightBear: TA,False
livelyBison: So is the consensus that he’s not an asshole but more effort should be made?,False
"openGorilla: He didn't put a halt to the communication, his wife did",False
eagerMonkey: I feel like she was not being an asshole at all,False
eagerMonkey: Seemed like she handled the situation very well,False
"curiousHippo: I think that this person was being TA, because she could have said that in a much nicer way",False
curiousHippo: They may not have even realized they were excluding her,False
"fulfilledBison: So long as she is telling the truth, which we assume is the case, and she did in fact say her feelings nicely, she isn't an asshole.",False
novelCamel: I wonder did the son and partner consider they were making things awkward by speaking french when he could clearly speak english,False
eagerMonkey: She said she very nicely told them she thought it was rude they were speaking a language she didnt understand,False
eagerMonkey: Seemed ok to me,False
"livelyGiraffe: Same. I didn't think the son was necessarily being rude by speaking a few sentences in French (the partner could have been telling him he felt sick or something), but the son is TA for telling the mom it made things awkward and making a big",False
delightedDolphin: yes its's reasonable that she want to be included because it is her house and they are guests. i dont think shes TA,False
livelyGiraffe: deal out of nothing. I don't think the mom was TA at all.,False
"curiousHippo: She said she ""found it disrespectful they were excluding her"" ",False
eagerMonkey: I agree livelyGiraffe,False
curiousHippo: that doesn't sound very nice ,False
livelyGiraffe: curiousHippo,False
"fulfilledBison: Yeah, that's the feeling she communicated in a nice way, not what she said verbatim",False
livelyGiraffe: are you saying they're both TA or just the mom?,False
eagerMonkey: But she was just explaining her feelings so i dont think she’s TA,False
novelCamel: definitely the son,False
"curiousHippo: I thought the mom was, but now I'm rereading it because of what you all are saying ",False
brightOtter: I think if they are in your home at least they can include her in the conversation as a group.  The can speak French later in private.,False
fulfilledBison: I mean I'd love more details about what she actually said but we have to take the OP at their word in these cases,False
"inspiredZebra: I don't think she is either, she did say she told them nicely; had to reread it.",False
eagerMonkey: Agreed inspiredZebra,False
livelyGiraffe: fulfilledBison I agree. Details seem too sparse to see the OP's perspective on it,False
novelCamel: he can speak english so why are they speaking in french anyway,False
inspiredZebra: nov,False
livelyGiraffe: * I mean OP's son's,False
curiousHippo: He was more comfortable speaking it,False
"eagerMonkey: Right, this time it said he could speak English but just had an accent",False
novelCamel: that's fine if they are alone not at someone elses home,False
livelyGiraffe: novelCamel I was thinking maybe he had to tell his partner something embarassing or private?,False
"inspiredZebra: Oops, but I agree novelCamel They could have saved it for when they're alone.",False
"delightedDolphin: yes agreed, they can speak French when they are alone",False
fulfilledBison: I can't really think of a better way she could've communicated her feelings,False
novelCamel: livelyGiraffe they could of waited til they were alone upstairs where he retreated to,False
"inspiredZebra: It could have been, which would make sense why they were speaking French but couldn't the son just say it was embarassing? I really wish there were more details than that.",False
eagerMonkey: I cant either,False
livelyGiraffe: inspiredZebra agree. ,False
livelyGiraffe: So does anyone think OP is TA based on what we've read?,False
novelCamel: so consensus is mom is not ta?,False
"curiousHippo: I still do, honestly ",False
eagerMonkey: Yes,False
fulfilledBison: I'm going not TA,False
novelCamel: nta,False
delightedDolphin: yes nta for me,False
livelyGiraffe: curiousHippo why?,False
brightOtter: The mother was excluded from a group conversation. The son should have included her.,False
curiousHippo: I think she is TA because of the way she worded everything. She automatically assumed they were attempting to exclude her,False
"inspiredZebra: nta for me but I wish they would have mentioned like they were all talking together and then it happened, opposed to we were all just sitting there and then they spoke French.",False
inspiredZebra: Just something more than the few vague sentences we got.,False
fulfilledBison: Such is the flaw of AITA in general,False
fulfilledBison: you rely on the word of the potential asshole,False
delightedOtter: I feel the writer is the asshole in this situation,False
"eagerHorse: Yes, I think she is an asshole",False
"fulfilledCamel: I agree, I think he was the asshole too.",False
inspiredHippo: I feel like this person is the asshole. I know his husband feels uncomfortable finding the right words but you won't learn if you don't practice,False
"eagerHorse: its just for the weekend, she can speak english infront of her mother",False
livelyZebra: yes me to the writer is an asshole because he lived in his mother house,False
"eagerHorse: he understands english, just shy about it",False
inspiredHippo: They should make a better attempt to bond with the mother,False
novelGorilla: I think her husband is.  If they are going to live in both countries he needs to speak English and not be shy.,False
"lightGiraffe: Agreed.  I sympathize with the husband, but at least he can follow somewhat.",False
livelyZebra: He is not the owner so he needed to respect his mother,False
eagerHorse: this is an opportunity for him to improve,False
"delightedOtter: His mother provided housing and food, and her son wouldn't even speak her language in her home.",False
"fulfilledCamel: I think the big problem was that the mother was hosting both of them, so it's rude to not include her in conversations in her own house",False
livelyZebra: He can easily solve the problem by using both English and Germany on his conversation,False
"eagerHorse: plus its only for a weekend, he will only get better if he practices",False
"inspiredHippo: Yes, definitely, I agree",False
eagerHorse: fulfilledCamel I agree,False
eagerHorse: livelyZebra yes,False
"delightedOtter: Also, the husband was capable of speaking English, he just didn't feel like it, but the mother didn't have the option of understanding German.",False
livelyZebra: He can even try to teach his husband some English just to get by with his mother,False
"eagerHorse: delightedOtter yep, correct",False
novelGorilla: She needs to have a conversation with the husband and he needs start using English or their marriage will not work.,False
livelyZebra: so in this case everybody is agree that the writer is an Asshole?,False
eagerHorse: so far,False
eagerHorse: yes,False
"delightedOtter: Yes, I believe so.",False
fulfilledCamel: It seems so,False
inspiredHippo: Yes,False
lightGiraffe: Looks like.,False
livelyZebra: Cool Thank You everyone.,False
novelGorilla: Yes,False
eagerHorse: openDolphin what about you,False
eagerHorse: Bear?,False
"eagerHorse: I did consider both sides, I dont think the husband or the wife are being reasonable.",False
fulfilledCamel: Does anyone have an argument for why he isn't the asshole?,False
novelGorilla: I say that the husband is the bigger asshole,False
inspiredHippo: Haha yes I agree,False
eagerHorse: I think the mother has a right to be hurt. And her request to speak english to include her is valid,False
inspiredHippo: It's a bit disrespectful ,False
livelyZebra: Yes but the write is the one asking the question so in this case we blame the write as an Asshole,False
"eagerHorse: Actually, I think the daughter is the biggest asshole",False
eagerHorse: this is her mother,False
"delightedOtter: Yeah, it wasn't like they were in a crowded environment, it was just his mother's home. Would have been easy to speak English.",False
eagerHorse: in her mothers home,False
"lightGiraffe: I understand the husband, because languages and new places can be tough.  But he needs to be pushed into doing better",False
"delightedOtter: They were a gay couple, said they were both male in the text.",False
eagerHorse: sorry delightedOtter,False
livelyZebra: Yes they are both male,False
"inspiredHippo: Yes, he can at least start with simple english",False
eagerHorse: okay either way,False
"eagerHorse: still same, sexual preference doesnt change situeation",False
"delightedOtter: Np, doesn't really impact the decision of them being in the wrong.",False
inspiredHippo: I've had wonderful conversations with people that only knew broken english. It's about the effort and attitude more than anything else,False
"novelGorilla: Regardless, the mother is not the asshole.  The newlyweds are.",False
"delightedOtter: I agree, the person who wrote the post is the asshole, and the mother is not.",False
eagerHorse: everyone put in your verdict at the top please,False

inquisitiveGiraffe: She's definitely not the asshole,False
"excitedGorilla: I agree, the mother is not the asshole",False
inquisitiveGiraffe: She's just asking them to respect her,False
brightZebra: the fact that the partner can speak english,False
brightZebra: They are guess at the house so they needed to respect the owner of the house,False
"excitedGorilla: if all can speak English but not all speak French, its only reasonable.",False
curiousCamel: It's just a week the son in law has to speak english... why wouldn't you want to communicate with someone you are visiting?,False
livelyHippo: It is entirely reasonable for her to ask that.,False
eagerBear: The partner has a slight accent.  Big deal.  People from different parts of the US have accents.,False
brightZebra: They need to communicate better between each person,False
excitedGorilla: The husband is being an asshole for going up to the bedroom,False
"curiousCamel: And I don't think she made ""a big deal"" out of it, I think she efficiently voiced her opinion on the matter",False
lightBison: If she is hosting them in her house I think they should have the courtesy to not exclude her from conversation.,False
brightZebra: the accent is difficult to understand but it is does not stop her to communicate in English,False
excitedGorilla: curiousCamel I dont think so either,False
brightZebra: to conclude I think the writer is not an asshole,False
excitedGorilla: brightZebra I agree,False
livelyHippo: The son in law seems very inconsiderate to not even bother trying to talk in English,False
brightZebra: Thank you everyone,False
excitedGorilla: livelyHippo yep. Asshole all the way!,False
"curiousCamel: Yay, looks like we all agree",False
lightBison: I don't like how he said that the mother made it awkward but I'm sure it was awkward for her in the first place that they were excluding her from conversations,False
eagerBear: The son should talk to his partner and tell him it is an opportunity to practice his English.,False
excitedGorilla: lightBison exactly.,False
"livelyHippo: She could have worded it a bit better, but she was probably upset in the moment.",False
"excitedGorilla: Bear, I agree with that also. ",False
brightZebra: i agreed,False
excitedGorilla: livelyHippo I think she worded it fine.,False
"curiousCamel: Yes, she was very nice about it",False
"excitedGorilla: okay I reread, ",False
"excitedGorilla: instead of calling them disrespectful, she could have just said Hey I want to be apart of this too",False
"excitedGorilla: okay, I get that. thanks for pointing that out.",False
"inquisitiveGiraffe: That might have been a better way to phrase it, to make them less defensive",False
curiousCamel: Perhaps they are upset because she spoke to them like children (instead of like young adults),False
"lightBison: Yeah that's true, that would have been a better way to approach it.",False
eagerBear: I really can't think of a good argument from the other point of view that makes her the asshole.,False
curiousCamel: Me neither,False
excitedGorilla: She was much nicer than I would have been :),False
curiousCamel: LOL,False
"livelyHippo: Yeah, i agree with that. Getting heated in the moment is easy to do, and definitely doesn't make her an asshole.",False
curiousCamel: She was much nicer than my mother would have been,False
excitedGorilla: ha,False
"livelyHippo: Haha, yeah, excluding your own mother in HER house is really rude.",False

"excitedDolphin: Hey everyone. I think the parent has the right to be included in the conversation, so they're not really the asshole here",False

"delightedBison: The husband knows the language.  Group setting in your hosts house, speak the language.",False
"brightHippo: inspiredElephant the partner needs to be the one to respect the mother in this situation, not the son. The son hasn't done much wrong but he is complicit",False

inspiredElephant: That's pretty assholey to be a guest and never speak the language if you know it,False

"eagerGiraffe: Yes, translating would have been helpful.",False
inquisitiveCamel: Exactly! They can speak French in private but excluding her isn't great.,False

"novelHorse: True also the husband speaks English he shouldn't be embarrassed if he gets a word wrong, the mother should understand ",False

novelHorse: ok I think he is the asshole lol,False
curiousMonkey: they should not exclude the mother in conversation given that its her house.,False

livelyBison: I have mixed feelings about this,False
excitedDolphin: The mother seems to be making a reasonable request to ask them to speak English,False
inquisitiveOtter: inspiredZebra it was a private convo,False

inquisitiveHorse: That was my thought as well. He could simply translate what is being said.,False
"excitedCamel: But then, they could just leave his mom's house and go home. ",False

curiousHorse: It's not like the mother can learn German in a week,False
lightCamel: I do think that the mothers should have been informed ahead of time about how the husband feels about his English skills so that she would not be offended and feeling left out. ,False
"novelElephant: speaking german is not what makes him the asshole, it that he didnt include everyone in the room in the convo",False

curiousMonkey: they can speak in German when mom is not around,False
inquisitiveGorilla: They spend most of their time in another country so the time with his mom should be special and since she is hosting her request is not disrepectful.,False
novelBison: It may be a pain but I feel like to make everyone feel included she can translate what he doesn't know how to say or understand. ,False
curiousMonkey: and mom can help him find the right words and reassure him that its ok if he doesn't have the right words,False
"inspiredBear: this could have been an oppurtunity to bring his husband and mother closer, but speaking in german the whole time just shoved a wedge between everyone involved.",False
inquisitiveGorilla: I think he should be ok being a little uncomfortable for his husband if it makes his time with his mom more enjoyable.,False
novelBison: Ultimately it is the mothers home and they should stick with her simple request. ,False
inquisitiveGorilla: I don't think he is going to get made fun of!,False

"eagerGiraffe: They need get over it, he does not spend the time with you that he does with him, they can adjust while they are there.",False
eagerGiraffe: His partner should be willing to do this for him if not for you.,False
lightHippo: Maybe after some time apart they can realize it is not rude. Possibly teach mom some words or sayings in French ,False
"fulfilledOtter: She ddefinitely could have been more delicate about the situation, but they were being disrespectful to her.",False
"novelGorilla: I agree she could have pulled her son aside and said something, but he should be speaking English in the first place",False
"eagerGiraffe: Maybe so, but there reaction was infantile.",False
eagerGiraffe: Their reaction that is.,False
lightHippo: I agree to get mad and storm off is very childish ,False
novelGorilla: I agree their reaction was way out of line,False
"fulfilledOtter: She probably embarassed her son's partner, but still they are in her houes.",False

novelGorilla: It never hurts to learn new things. That is important for your brain to keep sharp.,False
novelGorilla: I would not mind learning a different language.,False
lightOtter: My initial thought was that the writer was being insensitive.,False
novelGorilla: Did you change your mind?,False
"livelyHorse: I think this guy is out of line.  He should have had his wife approach her mother about learning the language.  It's never good to argue with in-laws.  Hopefully, he can mend fences.",False
inquisitiveMonkey: Eight years is a long time to be in a country and not understand the passable language to get around.,False

lightOtter: But the edit clarified that he did in fact approach the conversation gently and that he was trying to help his family.,False
novelGorilla: It would be annoying to be called any hour of the day.,False
excitedBear: No I dont think they are. The mother in law is looking for someone to do things for her. There is no reason why she couldn't try to learn English. The family just doesnt want to push her to do it.,False
"curiousHippo: I think that there needs to be someway for the poster to express himself differently to the parents, they are older and would have a harder time learning then some",False
"curiousHippo: Maybe instead of demanding they learn English, he would get them a translating program",False
inquisitiveMonkey: I don't think he used those exact words. He said he was polite and respectful.,False
brightDolphin: He is right that his mother in law needs to learn English since she has been living in America for 8 years.,False
lightOtter: Also learning that she has been in the US for 8 years makes me think that she definitely could've learned more English by now if she wanted to.,False
novelGorilla: I totally agree she needs to learn English to be more independent.,False
brightDolphin: It sounds like his mother in law is dragging her feet in learning English.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I agree. I don't think it's unreasonable for his mother in law to at least make some effort instead of depending on him.,False
"lightOtter: Overall, I don't think that the author of the post is being unreasonable.",False
"curiousHippo: I am sure they could learn English at least some, but if he has been dong this for 8 years then they have came to rely on him and expect it.",False
livelyHorse: I would think she tries to learn the language.  I know I would want to learn the language in a foreign country.  Maybe she has a learning block.  Maybe she needs to be pushed a little more but from her family.,False
"excitedBear: I agree, I dont think he's being unreasonable",False
brightDolphin: He said he was polite and respectful in explaining the need for his mother in law to learn English.,False
brightDolphin: I think the mother in law took it the wrong way.,False
livelyHorse: I don't think he was being unreasonable but I do believe his action was not justified.,False
lightOtter: Why don't you think he was justified?,False
"curiousHippo: I think he should have offered assistnace then, or at least posted the exact phrasing of how he spoke, since his actions seemed to show rudeness",False

"novelGorilla: He did give her different idea to learn English, classes, etc.",False

novelGorilla: I would want to learn a new language living in a different country,False
lightOtter: I think that he was justified in encouraging her to learn English.,False
"curiousHippo: It is my opionion that yes, I agree they should learn English, I think that the poster had been assisting them for 8 years and to finally snap and demand they change is a little much",False
livelyHorse: This person was being an asshole.  When dealing with in-laws you must show respect and compassion.  It was not his place to reprimand his mother in law.  ,False
openCamel: The woman should not push off her responsibility to her husband,False
novelZebra: Her parents need to learn English since they are living in the U.S.,False

novelZebra: It seems like her parents are just dragging their feet in learning English. ,False
openCamel: The husband is right for being upset with his wife,False

"openCamel: Once in a while he would help, but should not be expected to be there all the time",False
novelZebra: She needs to stop putting this extra burden on her husband to translate everytime they need something translated.,False
inquisitiveElephant: I think she should encourage her mom to learn English rather than have these expectations on her husband.,False
inspiredOtter: She needs to apologize to her husband,False
"openCamel: She should ask him, not expect him to do it for her",False
fulfilledDolphin: The poster needs to do it herself or find an alternate solution to help her parents. It's not her husband's responsibility.,False
"delightedHorse: I thnk that the husband should help, he did know this when he married her, but the wife shouldn't just expect him to drop everything to help them.",False
inquisitiveElephant: Does everyone agree that she is the asshole?,False
inspiredOtter: I do,False
openCamel: Yes I do,False
lightBison: yes I agree,False
novelZebra: She needs to step up to the plate and encourage her parents to learn English since they are living in America.,False
"delightedHorse: yes, I agree",False
novelZebra: she is the ah.,False

openCamel: Good we all agree,False
openOtter: Salvador when I was 15. Spanish is my first language,False
openOtter: I'm TA for expecting him to translate for my parents,False
eagerCamel: I don't think anyone is an asshole. I think the daughter could talk to her mom and explain that her husband has a lot to do,False
openOtter: My parents have been working hard to make it in this country their whole lives,False
lightGorilla: I don't think anyone is the asshole in this scenario,False
lightGorilla: They could just politely suggest a cool new app that teaches English or translates,False
eagerCamel: some simple communication should solve this issue,False
brightGiraffe: YOU CANNT EXCEPT YOUR HUSBAND ALWAYS TO HELP YOUR FAMILY .YOU SHOULD COSIDER SOME OTHER WAY,False
delightedMonkey: I can see why the husband is annoyed that the mom calls him direct.  If he called the daughter first and then she asks him to take over that seems more reasonable.,False
openOtter:  I don't see how he can't spend like 10 minutes,False
lightGorilla: I agree simple communication and it doesn't have to be rude. I think everyone had a natural reaction.,False
"excitedZebra: It seems like they were both being assholish in a way. I shouldn't be forced to help someone's parents, but learn English is never really a viable argument for anything. They perhaps need a better tone with each other",False
inquisitiveBison: I believe that the husband is right.In America English is spoken and this should be respeted,False

openOtter:  I'm TA for expecting him to translate for my parents ,False
delightedMonkey: You can speak whatever language you want in this country.  But to function you should over time learn English.  Otherwise you are just a dependent.  It sounds like they have been here many years.,False
lightGorilla: That's why they are calling him right? To learn english!,False
lightGorilla: they are trying,False
brightGiraffe: yes she is the asshole in my point of view,False
lightGorilla: he now just needs to politely suggest a different way for them to study,False
excitedZebra: I'd go with yes she's an asshole,False
delightedMonkey: Maybe study rather than ask the husband to be the translator app or book,False
brightGiraffe: he just conveyed he is annoyed .its not his fault,False
lightGorilla: Yes I agree they could study more,False
inquisitiveBison: i agree on tht,False

inspiredMonkey: I agree that she could try harder to learn english but at the same time we never know what she is going through or what issues she may have,False
lightBison: I don't think he was an asshole as he is trying to give her resources to learn,False
"delightedBear: I understand his frustration. He could voice his opinion a bit better, but he isn't necessarily wrong. ",False
"inquisitiveOtter: I can sorta see where he's coming from, but his response was unacceptable",False
inspiredMonkey: He did the right thing though by politely giving her the resources.,False
inquisitiveOtter: he needs to apologize and maybe if he wants her to learn quicker offer some help or resources,False
lightBison: In the edit of the post he said he worded it nicer than how he wrote in the descrption,False
inquisitiveOtter: explain how he did it ,False
openGiraffe: he is polite .he coveyed openly what he thinked,False
excitedHippo:  They said what i did was incredibly disrpesectful and that I'm flaunting,False
inspiredMonkey: But he just sounds like an asshole because just because he is able to learn languages doesn't mean that it is that easy for the next person,False
excitedHippo: They went on about how I'm a racist trump,False
"delightedBear: There tends to be a mentality if you live in a area that is mainly Latino, they become comfortable and never try to learn.",False
"inquisitiveOtter: also, it's easier to learn things younger. He may have learned in school or sometime when he had extra time to do so",False
lightBison: 8 years is long enough to at least be able to say the basics such as ordering food ,False
excitedHippo: stop pointing that out everyone fucking knows that,False
openGiraffe: it being 8 years .not learning the language were she lives,False

openGiraffe: he is not asshole thats for sure,False
inspiredMonkey: But he said that he is the last resort. She would go to other family members first.,False

inspiredMonkey: Agreed his reaction was a bit overstated,False
"excitedHippo: official language, stop pointing that out everyone fucking knows that",False
excitedHippo: restaurant and can't really do much without a family member with her,False
inspiredMonkey: Everyone knows what?,False
inquisitiveOtter: there's a difference between honestly and being rude. You can tell someone something without being rude to them,False
inquisitiveOtter: he was sorta a jerk here,False
openGiraffe: because in eight years its her family fault not to learn the language  were they live,False
delightedBear: Could just been overflowing over time. Perhaps that is why he blew up.,False
lightHorse: I believe this person is the asshole.,False
excitedHippo: My initial thought is it's sort of rude to come into someone elses house and not include them in conversation,False
novelBison: I think it is rude for her to stay at her mothers home and only speak a language that her mother doesn't understand,False
openCamel: I do too she can't share in the conversation if she doesn't understand what's being said.,False
delightedGorilla: This person isn't the asshole because he is trying to accommodate his husband in an unfamiliar environment. ,False
brightDolphin: I think its rude but I don't think it makes her an asshole ,False
brightDolphin: I think they're stuck in a tough situation,False
excitedHippo: They could easily speak German when they're a lone like in the room they don't have to do it at all times especially since he does speak English,False
novelBison: If anything she should translate what she is saying from German into English for her mom,False
brightDolphin: That is true ,False
openCamel: I've been in the same situation and you can't share if you can't understand the language.,False
"lightHorse: If the two options are save a little face for one person and cutting off another person from the conversation entirely or make someone a little embarrassed, choosing the former is an asshole move.",False
"novelBison: Yes, it really excludes her mom.",False
openCamel: He could at least translate to his mom and it could be a learning opportunity for both of them.,False
lightHorse: Especially since you're cutting off your host.,False
openCamel: But completely disregarding her is being an asshole.,False
"delightedGorilla: He needs to explain to his mother about how it makes the husband feel uncomfortable, and if she doesn't understand, he is not the asshole.",False
novelBison: cutting off mom from being a part of the conversation in her home is the asshole,False
brightDolphin: I agree I think explaining the situation would make it a lot better ,False
excitedHippo: Especially since the husband does understand AND speak English just not that well while the mom knows no German,False
"lightHorse: This also put the German husband is a bad position, it's very possible he would've liked to at least try to include the mom who's hosting for him.",False
openCamel: The husband is going to be in situations where he has to be around English speakers anyway.,False
brightDolphin: but just cutting out is very rude,False
openCamel: They can't hang out with friends and just talk to each other it's rude.,False
excitedHippo: Exactly Open openCamel,False
eagerOtter: The frames of the constitutions protect against unfounded criminal and very  rude,False
excitedHippo: Like would they do that around his American friends? Probably not,False
"delightedGorilla: If he doesn't explain the situation and just keeps speaking german when all three are in the room than he is being the asshole, but clearly he is considering both sides, and the husband is really important to him.",False
lightHorse: This all seems pretty unanimous lol,False
novelBison: It would be good if the  girl would translate into English when mom is around. ,False
openCamel:  I could understand the boyfriend's hesitation but I'm the sure mom would understand and would like to learn more about him they're family now.,False
eagerOtter: Their jury and mother was suffer a lot,False
excitedHippo: It's 2 married men correct? Just want to get my pronouns right lol,False

brightDolphin: like just leaving out is super rude,False
lightHorse: Oh yeah they're both males.,False

"delightedGorilla: Well then think about the husband, if he only talks in english, he'll have a hard time joining the conversation.",False
openCamel: Yeah it is I had partner that spoke another language and when I was around her friends I felt uncomfortable because I couldn't join the conversation,False
excitedHippo: Yes I think the husband is TA,False
eagerOtter: They involve from discriminatory ground and have an effect of nullifying ,False
openCamel: Overall I think they both need to compromise but leaving the mother out is rude.,False
delightedGorilla: I don't think the husband is TA,False
delightedGorilla: It can be worked out,False
brightDolphin: I think they need to compromise for sure but right now he is being rude,False
novelBison: yes compromise for sure,False
openCamel: Yes I agree it can be worked out I agree.,False
eagerOtter: They behaviours become repetitive they are defined as bullying,False
"excitedHippo: I think going to your mothers house, who's hosting you and feeding you, who you haven't seen in a while and not including her in convo is an a-hole move",False
delightedMonkey: I don't think this person is an asshole for kindly asking to be involved in the conversation.,False
inquisitiveOtter: I don't think she is the asshole.,False
eagerElephant: I don't think the mom is being a complete asshole.  Excluding people from conversations is rude.,False
fulfilledGorilla: I think what she is saying is very reasonable ,False
inquisitiveOtter: She wasn't rude when she asked them to include her,False
lightHippo: The person is not TA because the couple are clearly excluding him from the conversation.,False
eagerElephant: So she's just supposed to sit there and they have a conversation amongst themselves and she can't participate. ,False
inspiredBear: This scenario feels a little different then the last one. I get that it's rude to exclude people from converstations in their own house I just think she should have talked to her son and had him give the info to his boo,False
inquisitiveOtter: her son is the asshole for not being considerate while staying there,False
fulfilledGorilla: I think she was also polite ,False
"lightHippo: And he asked them to include him, and then he just storms upstairs. He's not willing to work it out. It's not the person's fault",False
delightedMonkey: The son said the parent was making a big deal out of it and making people feel awkward. It doesn't sound like they made a big deal out of it and what's awkward is speaking a language some people in the room don't understand and ,False
eagerElephant: That's like going to a restaurant with someone and they're speaking on their cellphone to someone else and you can't hear the conversation.,False
delightedMonkey: completely excluding them from the conversation.,False
inspiredBear: True I don't think she was mean ,False
inquisitiveOtter: exactly eagerElephant,False
eagerElephant: You're just sitting there and it's rude.,False
fulfilledGorilla: I think especially because its her house,False
inquisitiveOtter: I think what she did was completely reasonable. Especially in her own home,False
inspiredBear: True I agree- not involving everyone in a group in the convo is rude,False
inspiredBear: Especially in her home- all good points. ,False
eagerElephant: Exactly if I was visiting someone who only speaks another language I'd try to use a translator so at least I could join in.,False
"delightedMonkey: What's worse if the son's partner speaks English, so they easily could've just been speaking English in the first place.",False
inspiredBear: And the boo does speak English,False
"lightHippo: Why are we talking about ""her""? The story was just about a father and his son and partner only speaking in French around him. He got upset for a reason and is not TA.",False
eagerElephant: Exactly at inspiredBear,False
inquisitiveOtter: yes it's not like he can't speak any English at all,False
delightedMonkey: The gender of the parent wasn't revealed or hinted at in any way.,False
inspiredBear: Oh fair I just thought it was a mom because the last one was a mom- my bad,False
eagerElephant: I could see his boyfriend's side that he may be embarrassed by his accent but I'm sure the mother wouldn't care.  A lot of Americans like French accents.,False
inquisitiveOtter: i assumed it was a mom too,False
delightedMonkey: It's all good.,False
"lightHippo: The son's husband went upstairs, refusing to talk, and the son told him he was making a big deal. It was reasonable that he felt left out and wanted to talk in English.",False
"fulfilledGorilla: Exactly he can speak English, even if its not great they can explain that part to the parent and say that if he doesn't understand something he can ask his partner for translation",False
delightedMonkey: I think it's pretty unanimous lol,False
eagerElephant: Just walking away doesn't solve anything.,False
eagerElephant: I think so as well at del,False
inspiredBear: Perfect so we agree the parent is not TA?,False
"lightHippo: Yeah one walked away, and the other didn't want to actually talk it out. The person is not TA.",False
eagerElephant: So I have to agree the mom was definitely not being an asshole the son was.,False
delightedMonkey: You all seem like a nice group of people. ,False
inspiredBear: You too delightedMonkey,False
"fulfilledGorilla: The son was being unreasonable, the parent was not. ",False
inquisitiveOtter: yes def not being an asshole,False

fulfilledElephant: I understand his frustration,False
fulfilledElephant: Not an asshole,False
livelyBison: I think that he is not the asshole in this scenario. After 8 years I think it is fair for him to be upset that he is still having to translate for his mother in law. ,False
fulfilledElephant: I agree.  8 years is plenty of lead time,False
excitedCamel: I feel that this comes down to a case of someone not wanting to be independent of others. I also understand that some have difficulty learning new languages especially english,False
lightDolphin: She did say in important circumstances they would switch. and grandparents usually arent aware. of custody days ,False
excitedCamel: however living somewhere that the main language is english makes it much easier,False
livelyBison: He also gave her learning materials which was nice of him.,False
livelyBison: Also it makes it clear he was polite when he finally broke down and confronted her that he was polite,False
"curiousHorse: Yes, the fact that the person has to translate for basic things over the course of an entire day could definitely get annoying.",False
"livelyBison: I know on her end it is hard to learn english, but again 8 years is a long time.",False
excitedCamel: Agreed,False
lightDolphin: agree,False
fulfilledElephant: He probably should have said something prior to 8 years but still doesn't make him an asshole,False
excitedCamel: I am not someone who has a knack for learning foreign languages but you best believe id figure it out if i lived somewhere english is not common,False
fulfilledElephant: Agree,False
curiousHorse: True,False
"livelyBison: I agree, i feel like it would actually be harder NOT to learn a language you are constantly around for that long",False
lightDolphin: no hes not an asshole,False
excitedGiraffe: So where do we stand on this topic,False
brightElephant: she is the asshole because it is not fair of the Wife to have the husband to drop his life all the time,False
brightElephant: it would be understandable if it was only a one time thing,False

brightElephant: agreed,False
"lightCamel: I agree, he married her despite knowing the parents were old and it could be hard for them to learn the new language, so he should be okay with a little bit of translating",False

fulfilledHorse: it does not seem as if the wife is being unreasonable ,False
excitedBison: i agree,False
brightDolphin: i think so too.,False

brightDolphin: I mean it if is everyday than that is a lot because I have a feeling that her parents would need most things translated so I would say that would be alot,False
"openMonkey: I don't think she's demanding that her husband do it. It says in the story the mom has started only calling the husband, so I think they should start off by having a conversation with the mom about maybe splitting her time by calling them",False

lightCamel: he said he doesn't know where it went wrong,False
"openHorse: Yes, it does seem like the family is hanging up on him.",False
excitedBear: we agree. he was not polite. but new language is difficult,False

lightBison: I feel like if the son's partner could speak english comfortably it wasn't an unreasonable request.,False
"eagerGorilla: being in a conversation, if any one of the members is unable to understand, then it should be fairly considered",False
delightedMonkey: She's right they are rude to exclude her.,False
"lightBison: I do agree that bringing it up in private with the son would have been better, but I wouldn't say the parent is an asshole here.",False
"excitedZebra: It would be different if the son and husband were doing a small sidebar to clarify something, it would be different, but having a full-blown conversation that some in the room can't understand is rude",False
"eagerGorilla: yes, her son is very rude as one of our member says",False

fulfilledGiraffe: She definitely didn’t express her feelings well.,False
inquisitiveHippo: the son will just respect what the mum sayed,False
delightedMonkey: It will be good practise for him to speak Englsih.,False
openOtter: Perhaps his husband is very nervous and his command of English isn't as good as the mother believes.,False
"eagerGorilla: if its so difficult to speak in English, then her son could have translated",False
fulfilledGiraffe: I do not think she was being an asshole.,False

delightedMonkey: Pourquoi pas?,False
novelCamel: But it's all about tone I suppose. It could have come across differently in person,False
lightBison: I think she saw it as disrespectful because she was being excluded from their conversations,False
curiousHorse: true I also think some effort needs to be made on her part eventually to learn french ,False
openOtter: The conversation probably had nothing to do with her but the son could have given her a summary of their conversation in English for her if she was insecure about it.,False

inquisitiveGorilla: I  agree with delightedBear there was a middle ground here.,False
novelElephant: half of the time he spends with his husband satisfying his partner,False

inquisitiveCamel: This now poses a dilemma for me becuase we're now at my mother's house.,False

excitedHippo: I agree the all general thought process,False
brightBison: I think that the person should have considered her feelings and maybe approached it differently,False
"novelMonkey: I can see how op would be annoyed with the frequent requests, but I think they could've approached it with more understanding as well.",False
openHorse: Anyone who is living in a country for a significant period of time should have a solid grasp of the primary language used there,False
excitedHippo: I think the person is asshole. ,False
brightBison: I agree too that after 8 years he would be sick of it. ,False
"livelyCamel: I said they were in the wrong, but only because he should feel some of sort of obligation to help the mother in law out of respect.",False
novelMonkey: I agree that op ITA in how they handled it.,False
brightBison: Like help her learn english. ,False
excitedHippo:  I'm flaunting my white privlege by doing this shit. I like this lines.,False

brightBison: yes I agree to that.,False
livelyCamel: It might be really hard for her.  Some people are not really good with picking up new languages.,False
excitedHippo: I agree that.,False
openHorse: His edit made it seem like he was offering to help her learn,False
novelMonkey: Yeah helping the mother in law with language is the same as helping your family move or giving them a ride to the airport. It's annoying if you have to do it a lot but you still have to do it.,False
brightBison: Yes I think he is not an asshole.,False
"livelyCamel: Who knows, though?  Maybe the mother in law is the type to randomly call for ""help"" with every little thing and act helpless all the time.",False
openHorse: I think the OP was within reason by saying he is tired of translating. He didn't sign up for it and even offered to help her learn the language ,False
excitedHippo: I think very interesting that.,False
brightBison: I vote not an asshole. ,False

excitedGiraffe: I understand now why the husband in the previous scenario was so irritated.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I understand this survey.,False

openHippo: Yes I considered both sides. ,False
brightBear: And OP should be emphasizing the importance of learning the language and offering to help them out ,False
"excitedGiraffe: It seems like op doesn't expect the mom to try and learn the language at all, and thinks it's the husband's responsibility to translate simply because he has more time, which is on the asshole side.",False
fulfilledBison: I think this person should not push the parents off on their husband.,False

brightBear: OP is basically saying that the husband's time is less important than theirs,False
fulfilledBison: Yes,False
excitedGiraffe: Ooh that is a good point.,False
inquisitiveMonkey: I agree that,False
brightBear: That is ultimately why I chose that OP is the asshole ,False
excitedGiraffe: I was in the middle leaning toward NTA but I think disrespecting the husband's time is an asshole move regardless of the language thing.,False
brightBear: Have you guys ever done this survey before?,False
fulfilledBison: I'm leaning toward asshole.  Especially after she said she makes him translate.  Like he's a tool.,False

excitedGorilla: communication is key to helping each other understand.,False
"curiousHorse: If it's hurtful to either the mother or husband to only speak one language, then he needs to not be lazy and make the effort to translate.",False

"inquisitiveMonkey: I think instead of saying they were being disrespectful, She should have just asked what they were talking about.",False

curiousCamel: She doesn't have a RIGHT to hear their conversation,True

"lightDolphin: I think that the person is not at fault honestly. It's not his job to translate for his family, especially if he is busy doing something else.",False
novelCamel: I would agree with that. ,False
"openMonkey: I don't necessarily think it's asshole behavior to suggest the mother-in-law start learning English, but the tone he's using in the post rubbed me the wrong way.",False
brightBear: I don't think the guy is wrong in wanting his MIL to learn English. ,False
"curiousGorilla: Same, he's a little aggressive with his explanation of the story, but it's not his responsibility to translate.",False
livelyGiraffe: I believe that he is an asshole.  I am an Asian American and both my grandparents can't speak English,False
"delightedHippo: When it comes to in laws, i think its best to keep the peace...he should just respectfully refuse to help her if he's not available.",False
"lightDolphin: We can't consider his tone as part of the judgement though, he's probably kinda pissed.",False
fulfilledZebra: I don't feel this person is an asshole. If you visit any country in the world you will need to speak their language. ,False
novelCamel: He mention that his tone from the post is not the tone he used in the discussion.,False
livelyGiraffe: They've been here for 25 years and has always had a translator. ,False
"eagerHorse: I think he's somewhat wrong, mostly in tone. It's not unreasonable to expect someone to learn the language commonly spoke in the country they reside.",False
fulfilledZebra: The argument about the US not having an official language is moot. Switzerland has four official languages and you'll need to speak the language of whatever region you would visit. ,False
"lightDolphin: I think that if he offered to help her and offered tools and apps to learn English and did so in a kind way, then there is no reason to believe he's an asshole.",False
"livelyGiraffe: So i've always had to translate for my grandparents, or whoever is next to them",False
"brightBear: I think he's wanting her to be independent, which is understandable. If she has some sort of emergency she would need to communicate in English.",False
delightedHippo: My mil has lived here for over 30 years and refuses to speak english. she has hard time with learning new things. ,False
"openMonkey: I also think maybe it's not his place to suggest it to her directly. While I don't know much about his wife/her family's culture, but it might be disrespectful to talk to an elder like that.",False
openMonkey: Maybe he should have talked to his wife first about how he felt and gone from there.,False
livelyGiraffe: I think it would be disrespectful to tell her to speak English,False
brightBear: I agree with talking to the wife first ,False
"eagerHorse: Unfortunately, this MIL is not going to be able to learn English as she seems to deal mostly with Spanish speakers, which will make it very hard for her to learn English.",False
novelCamel: I do think it should have come from the wife,False
fulfilledZebra: He might have been gruff but he's not wrong.,False
"delightedHippo: yeah, he should talk to his wife about it first and have her talk to her about learning english.",False
"livelyGiraffe: Yea, i agree...it should come from immediate family",False
eagerHorse: He definitely should have spoken to the wife first,False
lightDolphin: I agree with the fulfilledZebra he isn't wrong,False
"curiousGorilla: I have a partner whose family doesn't speak English, but I'm not responsible for translating for them. I wouldn't be very pleased if they were contacting me all the time to translate either. Talking to the wife is a good point.",False
fulfilledZebra: I think it was okay for him to be direct. His wife's family doesn't seem to have a problem with using him for their benefit and tasks.,False
livelyGiraffe: But its not all the time,False
delightedHippo: he may not be wrong but it is always good to be respectful and be at peace with in laws,False
livelyGiraffe: shes only contacting him as a last resort if others don't pick up,False
"lightDolphin: Think about it from his perspective. Constantly getting calls from your MIL is annoying as hell, trust me",False
fulfilledZebra: No one wants to feel used.,False
"lightDolphin: Especially if she is only calling him to get translations. She could've also been using Google Translate. There are endless possibilities, and she shouldn't rely on others to translate for her",False
delightedHippo: my mil is annoying...but i try to show respect regardless of how i feel about her.,False
novelCamel: Also being married in it could be seen as more disrespectful if he doesn't answer the call.,False
"curiousGorilla: I think it's still fair, regardless of frequency if he says he doesn't want to be contacted for that though.",False
fulfilledZebra: I think if you move to another country where it is common to speak another language then learning that language is necessary.,False
"lightDolphin: I don't think it's necessary, but it should be expected, especially after 8 years.",False
"brightBear: or at least learning enough to be able to get yourself through the day grocery shopping, getting gas, etc",False
delightedHippo: the thing is in CA everyone knows some spanish.  you can get by not learning english most of the time.,False
"eagerHorse: No one is really being unreasonable in this situation, it's just really tonal issues. It's reasonable for him to be upset and it's reasonable for his MIL to not want to learn English",False
lightDolphin: So do we all agree he is not the asshole or does anyone think he is the asshole?,False
fulfilledZebra: Then if she could get by she wouldn't need to call him constantly. ,False
delightedHippo: not,False
fulfilledZebra: Not the asshole.,False
brightBear: not ,False
lightDolphin: Agreed,False
eagerHorse: not,False
novelCamel: NTA,False
livelyGiraffe: ok just go with not,False
curiousGorilla: NTA,False
openMonkey: NTA,False
delightedMonkey: I really think this woman is putting her husband in a hard situation.,False
"novelGiraffe: I think the poster is an asshole, for expecting her husband to do something when there are other, better alternatives.",False
brightZebra: I think she's an asshole ,False
excitedDolphin: I believe she is the asshole. Her husband isn't her family's personal taskmaster.,False
openElephant: I think she's being a bit of an asshole too.,False
"novelGiraffe: Also, it's important to note that the husband is not a native spanish speaker, and offered other apps like duolingo.",False
inspiredBison: she's an asshole for making her husband do that,False
inspiredBison: it's not his job,False
curiousCamel: I don't think the poster is an asshole. They clearly don't have as much time to do this and it doesn't seem like that unreasonable of a time commitment,False
"lightHippo: I think she's acting a little entitled, but I also feel like I want a better idea of how often he is being asked to translate.",False
"excitedDolphin: If you move anywhere in the world you will have to learn the language that is spoken there. It doesn't matter what the ""official"" language is - it matters what people speak. ",False
"brightZebra: She's putting a burden that she doesn't want, on to her husband ",False
"fulfilledOtter: yes, she is being TA.  she should not impose that on him, especially her own mother.",False
"inspiredBison: Yes, it's a burden on her husband",False
"openElephant: Yeah, it just isn't his responsibility and she has offloaded it on him as if it is.",False
delightedMonkey: I also don't understand how recommending learning a new language makes him privileged.  ,False
"novelGiraffe: I get that because they are married that it's his family, but constantly calling the husband for translations and stuff when there is google translate and other alternatives would get super annoying",False
inspiredBison: I would find it annoying if I had to translate all the time for my  wife's parents,False
fulfilledOtter: the fact that the husband does not like it should be a good indicator that she is imposing on him.,False
"lightHippo: If she's busy and in a Master's program, I don't think it's that big of a deal to ask him every once in a while, as she describes. But if it is constant, then she should seek alternatives.",False
excitedDolphin: There is nothing privileged about using Rosetta Stone. Most libraries offer it or something similar for free along with use of their computers.,False
novelGiraffe: The husband is not in the wrong for politely suggesting the poster's mother learn English or seek alternatives.,False
curiousCamel: They supposedly live in a predominately Latinx area of Cali so there shouldn't be that high of a demand for English translation,False
fulfilledOtter: there's probably a cultural disconnect.,False
"novelGiraffe: By relying on the husband to translate for her, the mother in law is putting herself at a disadvantage, by relying on someone else for a necessity.",False
excitedDolphin: And it sounds like her family often makes fun of him. He's putting up with a lot.,False
"openElephant: Yeah, and there are plenty of free phone apps that offer translation stuff too. Just so many alternatives and he's made it clear it feels like an imposition.",False
inspiredBison: So overall I think she's not an asshole after discussing it with you guys,False
novelGiraffe: I think she is the asshole,False
"curiousCamel: It's not unreasonable to ask the mother to learn English, but it's not asshole-ish to ask for spot translations",False
excitedDolphin: She's the asshole.,False
fulfilledOtter: yes agreed,False
"openElephant: Yeah, same.",False
novelGiraffe: I think it is assholeish to pass a job onto someone when they obivously don't feel comfortable doing so,False
delightedMonkey: I think she is TA because it's not his responsibility. ,False
curiousCamel: Offering duolingo and other things is a good start but there definitely needs to more of a conversation between the poster and the husband about this,False
inspiredBison: So all agree she's an asshole?,False
novelGiraffe: Exactly. She's the asshole,False
"fulfilledOtter: I would hate to put that kind of burden on my spouse, especially if they don't like it. it's different if they are willing to help.",False
"excitedDolphin: Yes, she's the asshole. They've somehow united against him. That isn't what family is about either.",False
"novelGiraffe: It seems like the poster just assumed her husband would help, without asking first.",False
"openElephant: In any case, I would feel like an asshole if I made my spouse do translating when they didn't want to, so yeah, I think she's the asshole.",False
"novelGiraffe: She said she ""passed it onto her husband"" because he isn't busy",False
"brightZebra: I can understand that she would be annoyed that it seems like he doesn't want to help, but she's being unreasonable in expecting him to drop whatever he's doing to play the role of translator ",False
"lightHippo: I don't think it's his responsibility and if it were someone he didn't know well at all, it would be a more clearcut situation. But I feel like maybe we're assuming some things that we don't know from the post alone.",False
fulfilledOtter: She should have apologized for the burden and give him a break or two.,False
novelGiraffe: Is there anyone that thinks she is not the asshole?,False
lightHippo: I do think his wife should take his feelings more into consideration than her post implies.,False
"lightHippo: I'm kind of on the fence, I don't think it's asshole-ish to ask for help, but maybe asshole-ish to react the way she did when he confronted her.",False
"fulfilledOtter: yes, big A",False
novelGiraffe: So do we all agree she is the asshole?,False
delightedMonkey: I think so ,False
brightZebra: I agree ,False

inquisitiveBear: I understand the mom's point of view and the daughter's.,False
lightCamel: mother ,False

livelyGorilla: happy moring,False
inquisitiveBear: The husband! My husband doesn't speak great English but still tries.,False
livelyGorilla: hii,False
lightCamel: so who's the ass?   ,False
inquisitiveBear: Why didn't the why translate the conversation so her mom could understand?,False
livelyGorilla: hii,False
"delightedDolphin: I think the mom's the asshole, but it's a matter of a lack of communication from all sides. If the daughter just told her mom about how her husband isn't comfortable with speaking English, the mom could've understood the situation",False
openOtter: i'm leaning toward the daughter and husband being the assholes.,False
inquisitiveBear: I meant wife!,False
livelyGorilla: hii,False
lightCamel: I agree openOtter,False
"inquisitiveBear: The wife is being considerate of her husband, but ignoring her mom!",False
"openOtter: they should have consideration for the mom who can't understand anything they're saying, especially if they're speaking right in front of her",False
inquisitiveBear: Agreed!,False
lightCamel: the daughter hasn't seen her mom in years then she pops in and speaks another language.. i find the daughter is the asshole ,False
openOtter: totally agree,False
lightCamel: daughter will have a lifetime speaking another language but moms house moms rules,False
"curiousZebra: Yes, good morning. Again it is easy to see both sides but given the circumstances she needs to include her mother.",False
"delightedDolphin: Yeah, I agree she could've done more to involve her mom in the conversation. She could've atleast given a summary of the topic of the conversation between her and her husband",False
"curiousZebra: Yes, this person is an asshole.",False
inquisitiveBear: I agree with including the mom in the conversation.,False
lightCamel: have a great day,False
livelyGorilla: hii,False
"openOtter: Yes, it's definitely rude not to translate",False
delightedMonkey: hi,False
fulfilledBear: Hi,False
lightGiraffe: hello,False
delightedMonkey: hello,False
curiousGorilla: The father is being perfectly reasonable.,False
"fulfilledBear: Yes, I believe the father was being reasonable as well.",False
curiousGorilla: The son is being crazy here.,False
fulfilledBear: The son can speak in French in private with his husband.,False
curiousGorilla: The spouse can speak English and chooses not to in front of his father-in-law.,False
"fulfilledBear: When the father is around though, they should try to involve him in the conversation and speak English",False
eagerHippo: I think it is rude to not include them in the conversation.,False
curiousGorilla: It is very rude.,False
"lightGiraffe: I agree, i think they should try they're best to speak English when in front of the parent so they wouldn't feel left out.",False
"curiousGorilla: My husband doesn't speak good English, and I always try to translate anything he says when others can't understand him.",False
"eagerHippo: I agree, leaving them out is rude!",False
curiousGorilla: And the son is acting very childish by throwing a tantrum.,False
"fulfilledBear: They were staying at his house, so they definitely should've been more respectful to him  ",False
eagerHippo: I was in a similar situation and it is very uncomfortable sitting there and having no clue what they are saying.,False
eagerHippo: I did consider both sides and it was rude behavior.,False
"curiousGorilla: I understand it is easier to speak in their mother tongue, but it's better to be accessible to the most people in the room.",False
eagerHippo: I agree.,False
"lightGiraffe: The parent told them in a nice way not to speak in another language in front of him, so I don't think the parent was being an asshole.",False
curiousGorilla: I agree,False
lightGiraffe: I completely understand where he is coming from.,False
eagerHippo: My thoughts at this point is the mom was not an asshole.,False
"eagerHippo: No, she was not an asshole!",False
curiousGorilla: It's looks like we all agree.,False
eagerHippo: Same here.,False
livelyBison: Hi,False
fulfilledGorilla: hellllo,False
inspiredHorse: I think they're the asshole,False
fulfilledGorilla: definitely,False
"livelyBison: So my first impression is that this is complicated. If you shout 'Speak English' at some random stranger in public, that's absolutely racist. People have every right to speak their native language no matter what country they're in.",False
"livelyBison: If the OP is ONLY complaining because they're tired of being an unpaid translator, that's a little selfish (but, hey, we all are), but not really racist. ",False
"curiousBear: Being that the guy was polite, I dont think hes in the wrong",False
"livelyBison: What makes me a little uncomfortable, though, is that he says that his wife's entire family needs to learn to speak English, even though her mother is the only one who can't function independently.",False
inspiredHorse: The OP wasn't a translator,False
fulfilledGorilla: part of being a good human being is helping others that need it. Not hard for me.,False
"curiousBear: The family had no right to mistreat him over this, and call him racist and such",False
livelyBison: I think his frustration probably came across more than he realized when he confronted his wife's family.,False
"inspiredHorse: its not even his family, it was his mother in law",False
curiousBear: Its also a matter of them not being entitled to his translation.,False
"livelyBison: Overall, I'd say this is about 50-50 is terms of who's responsible.",False
inspiredHorse: And we dont have the full story,False
curiousBear: Does everyone agree that hes not a racist because of this?,False
curiousBear: Yeah they definitely shouldnt have called him that,False
"fulfilledGorilla: I mean, we do have it from his perspective and he sounds like an asshole to me, even if when just regarding how he talks to people.",False
inspiredHorse: I don't think he had ill intentions,False
"curiousBear: He clarified at the end that he didnt actually say ""im tired of your shit"". He said he was polite about it",False
fulfilledGorilla: Of course he would say that.,False
"inspiredHorse: I don't really think he has a say in the matter, since it was only his mother in law",False
inspiredHorse: I would understand if it was his own mother,False
inspiredHorse: Are we all in agreement that the writer is the asshole?,False
"livelyGiraffe: I don't think the OP is the asshole. When you get married, you agree to share household tasks, ",False
"livelyGiraffe: whether that's picking milk up at the store or caring for aging parents. If her husband currently has more free time because she's a full-time worker and part-time student, it's reasonable to ask him to help out with her parents.",False
livelyGiraffe: I think she's also right to say that you can't assume it's easy to learn a new language online because you were able to do it.,False
"livelyGiraffe: Age, discomfort with technology, learning disabilities, physical health problems or competing responsibilites can all make the learning process much more difficult. ",False
fulfilledBison: Not the asshole. Easy.,False
"curiousGorilla: I agree with the husband on this, the wife should have volunteered him to translate",False
inquisitiveDolphin: We don't know the frequency of the calls,True
"curiousGorilla: Also, this woman should just learn the language instead of being dependent on other people",False
"inquisitiveDolphin: I don't think the husband ever wanted to be a translator, its not what he singed up for.",True
"curiousGorilla: Exactly, its rude to just sign someone up for something they didnt ask for like that",False
"livelyGiraffe: curiousGorilla - she's very elderly, though. What's the point of learning a language she's only going to use for a few years?",False
inquisitiveDolphin: Did you miss the part where they've been living in the country for years and the poster has been translating for them ,True
livelyGiraffe: curiousGorilla - but he DID sign up to deal with his wife's family when he married her,False
"curiousGorilla: I dont think we know shes ""very elderly""",False
curiousGorilla: for all we know she could be alive another 30 years,False
inquisitiveDolphin: I think that the poster is the asshole IF the frequency of calls is every few hours or a few times a day,True
inquisitiveDolphin: That would be really annoying,True
fulfilledBison: but we don't know that,False
"curiousGorilla: I dont agree that he signed up by marrying her, just because you marry someone doesnt mean their family is entitled to your help",False
"livelyGiraffe: inquisitiveDolphin - yeah, frequency definitely does matter. I wish there was more detail about that.",False
inquisitiveDolphin: Also in the tl;dr it seems like she is forcing her husband to translate,True
fulfilledBison: this timer is way too long,False
inquisitiveDolphin: It's weird,True
curiousGorilla: And its not like learning english would be some incredibly difficult journey,False
inquisitiveDolphin: i dont think thats the correct thinking,True
curiousGorilla: I think it would be reasonable to learn at least the basics of a language so that you can be self sufficient in that regard,False
livelyGiraffe: curiousGorilla - what do you think about my point about the barriers some people face to learning a new language?,False
"livelyGiraffe: curiousGorilla - age, learning disabilities, discomfort with technology, etc.?",False
inquisitiveDolphin: We dont know any of that livelyGiraffe,True
"curiousGorilla: Its a pretty fair point, but Im just working with the information im given. Im not aware of any mental illness or anything",False
"livelyGiraffe: We don't know if it's true in this particular case, but we also don't know that learning a language would be easy or even possible",False
fulfilledBison: correct,False
livelyBear: Good morning everyone,False

openDolphin: little bit only english known,False
openDolphin: mostly he knows only french,False
openDolphin: i think he is an asshole,False
brightHorse: I think the problem is this person is just not engaged in their conversation,False
"excitedOtter: I think it would be important to know if the son and the partner were speaking in a manner that was private, in which case, I would say the mother had no business being involved, except of course, that it is her home.",False
brightHorse: So this person feels she's being left out,False
openDolphin: yes i agree,False
livelyBear: If i was the dad and I invited them over knowning full well my son's partner mostly knows french then I should expect them to speak it and I wouldnt be so rude,False
openDolphin: she is not rude but whenever we all are gathering only common language we have to speak,False
livelyBear: but if the son asked if they can come over then i think it would be expected of them to speak more ewnglish becuasse they are the guests. ,False
"excitedOtter: Indeed, but if the host, the property owner, asks that they honor her request on her property, then I feel as though she has a case.",False
openDolphin: she felt guilty without knowing anything to talk with other members,False
openDolphin: i think the person is asshole,False
brightHorse: Yeah I guess there are a lot of details are missed here,False
livelyBear: Yes I agree openDolphin and livelyBear ,False

lightBear: and that there was more communication that could have been done,False
"eagerDolphin: Also being ""shy"" isn't a good reason not to speak english",False

novelHippo: communicating with others means there is not include shy,False
lightBear: not a good enough reason. ,False

novelHippo: he has shy then he won't come to u.s,False

delightedDolphin: This person is correct in their feelings,True
"novelGiraffe: I think the author here is correct in how they feel, but isn't considering the whole situation.",False
"fulfilledZebra: This person may be correct in their feelings, but based on how the scenario was written they don't seem to be handling it very well or respectfully.",False
curiousHippo: She is the asshole. She needs to respect her husband's personal time. She needs to look at it from her husbands's point of view.,False
"novelGiraffe: It doesn't seem like the husband did any of this translation before they were married, and now the author is making him suddenly do it.",False
brightMonkey: I definitely believe that both parties are at fault here.,False
"fulfilledZebra: I agree that the husband should be supportive of the wife's family and assist them, however I don't believe it needs to be solely his responsibility. ",False
delightedDolphin: I believe she is correct in her feeling perhaps not the way to go about it,True
"curiousHippo: Yes, they are married. But that don't mean, he have to obligation to it.",False
delightedDolphin: He should be supportive as family is family when they need help,True
brightMonkey: Yes I agree there was a lack of communication from both parties.,False
fulfilledZebra: So is she the asshole for perhaps having a valid viewpoint but handling it wrong?  Or is he the asshole for not wanting to help out all the time?,False
novelGiraffe: I think they are both assholes to an extent.,False
fulfilledZebra: Agreed,False
"delightedDolphin: Perhaps, lack of communication but he needs to bend a bit.",True
"brightMonkey: She's an asshole for not considering her husband's own time and extent of his ability to translate, and he could've handled the situation without having an outburst.",False
"curiousHippo: Yeah, definitely a lack of communication from both parties.",False
novelGiraffe: It also doesn't mention how she knows the husband has more free time.,False
delightedDolphin: Family issues should be a shared task.,True
"brightMonkey: Yes you are right, yet again, a lack of communication.",False
fulfilledZebra: Are we in agreement on who the ultimate asshole is?  Ultimately I think she is the asshole simply for how she is handling the situation. ,False
curiousHippo: i,False
curiousHippo: excitedBear are you a bot? ,False
novelGiraffe: I would agree that the author is an asshole here.,False
delightedDolphin: I still think he is the asshole for not understanding and helping out family member,True
curiousHippo: I think she is the asshole.,False

fulfilledCamel: Hello again!,False
brightGorilla: Hello everyone!,False
inspiredGiraffe: Hello,False
excitedDolphin: Hello all,False
inspiredGiraffe: My initial thought is that the author here is not the asshole.,False
fulfilledCamel: He is the asshole. He should've been more polite at the beginning. ,False
inspiredGiraffe: In the edit he mentions that he has been polite throughout his conversations.,False
eagerElephant: It appears that he is sincere in helping his MIL but was just venting and had perhaps a bad day,False
fulfilledCamel: Not the beginning.,False
eagerElephant: Correct.  He states that he was polite in his conversations with his MIL,False
"excitedDolphin: My thought is that the husband is being the asshole in this situation. I don't think there is anything wrong with encouraging the wife's family to learn English, or offering to help.",False
"inspiredGiraffe: He seemed to be venting in the beginning to Reddit, but when he was talking to them he says he was supeer polite.",False
eagerElephant: Stay on the task,False
"excitedDolphin: It does make sense that the wife's family be able to handle some situations on their own, in the event no one is able to help. ",False
brightGorilla: He comes off as an asshole but idk if he is since he was venting on his post.,False
excitedDolphin: I think he comes across as an asshole because he expresses his frustration with translating.  ,False
eagerElephant: He did offer to help his MIL,False
"brightGorilla: However, he does seem to be lacking the communication with his wife on the situation as a whole.",False
"fulfilledCamel: Plus, he needs to understand that, not everyone learns at the same speed. Everyone have different learning curves.",False
"inspiredGiraffe: I don't think he is the asshole, as he was trying to set them up with English lessons, and was willing to help throughout their learning.",False
"excitedDolphin: If he had left his frustration out of it, and simply offered to help out of concern, he wouldn't be an asshole. ",False
"inspiredGiraffe: That is true, but it seems as if they don't/aren't trying to learn English",False
eagerElephant: Don't we all get frustrated and sometimes vent,False
eagerElephant: ?,False
eagerElephant: ?,False
brightGorilla: We do and that's why I believe he's more of an asshole for not handling his emotions correctly and venting to his partner.,False
excitedDolphin: Agree with that. ,False
"eagerElephant: If his MIL is elderly, it would be hard for her to learn English",False
"fulfilledCamel: Yea, he needs to control his emotions. ",False
excitedDolphin: Also agree with that.,False
"inspiredGiraffe: It looks like he did bring it up with them, but he was shot down.",False
excitedDolphin: It may be harder for them to learn English which is why he should have remained supportive and not frustrated and asshole-ish. ,False
eagerElephant: I agree with the controlling emotions,False
