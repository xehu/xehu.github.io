Ravens Matrices,"<h1>Ravens Matrices</h1>

<p>Mapped by: xehu</p>

<h2>Stimulus Complex</h2>

<p>Participants are presented with a pattern, which usually looks like a matrix or grid with a white background. There is a missing piece to the pattern.</p>

<h2>Goal Directives</h2>

<p>The goal is to complete the pattern by identifying what the missing piece should be. The problem is multiple-choice, so participants will choose just one correct answer from a variety of options.</p>

Euclidean traveling salesperson,"<h1>Euclidean traveling salesperson</h1>

<p>Mapped by: xehu</p>

<h2>Stimulus Complex</h2>

<p>Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different “paths” by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a “path” between A and B.</p>

<h2>Goal Directives</h2>

<p>The goal is to find and select a sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a “traveling salesman” who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant’s goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.</p>

<h3>Other Allowed Processes</h3>

<p>In multiplayer mode, there can be multiple ways to implement the experience: it is possible for all players to look at the same map and select paths simultaneously; perhaps the system could then submit the best answer. Alternatively, only one person would be able to select the pathway at a time.</p>

<p>The explanation for the second image attached below: On the first trial the person chooses the equation A + B= and the experimenter tells the person that the solution to this equation is C. This is because A=3 and B=5, which sums to 8, the letter represented by C. The person then guesses that A represents the number 1 and the experimenter indicates that this is not the case, or False. On the second trial, the person asks the solution to the equation B + C= and is told that the answer is EA. This is because B=5 and C=8, which sums to 13 or EA.</p>
