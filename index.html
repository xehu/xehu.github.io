		<p> I'm a sophomore studying computer science at Stanford University, presently concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
		<p>I love solving complex problems at the intersection of humans and technologyâ€” for example, using technology to give workers rights, or using virtual reality to explore empathy.</p>
		<p>In Summer 2017, I worked in the Stanford CS Department's, Human-Computer Interaction Group, where I researched under professor Michael Bernstein. My work focused on increasing the quality of work on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I am also working with the Marketing Team at StartX, the Stanford-affiliated startup accelerator.</p>
