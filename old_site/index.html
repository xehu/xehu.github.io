			<p> I'm a junior studying computer science at Stanford University, concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
			<p>I love solving complex problems at the intersection of humans and technology— for example, using technology to give workers rights, or using virtual reality to explore empathy.</p>
			<p>From Summer 2017 to Winter 2018, I worked in the Stanford CS Department's Human-Computer Interaction Group, where I researched under professor Michael Bernstein. My work focused on increasing the quality of work on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I also worked with the Marketing Team at StartX, the Stanford-affiliated startup accelerator, and previously worked in the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford.</p>
			<p>I am currently interning at Microsoft for Summer 2018, where I am working on Cortana.</p>

				<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
				<p> My full name is Xinlan Emily Hu. I was born in China and never given a middle name at birth, so I only officially took the middle name "Emily" in January 2017, when I became a naturalized U.S. citizen! I wrote a little bit about my experience of being naturalized in <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2017/01/12/and-i-am-an-american/">this</a> Stanford Daily article.</p>
				<p> 
				In addition to being an avid writer, I am a competitive debater. I've been debating since high school and love the ability to think about a wide array of arguments—everything from international relations to social justice to finance. Debate constantly forces me to think outside the box and take on perspectives that I don't agree with, and I regularly tell people that debate has changed the way I see the world. It makes me more curious, more driven for change.</p>
				<p>
				Finally, one of my favorite pastimes is social dancing. Dancing brings out my free and creative side---and I'm always down to learn new figures, role-reverse, and finding new dance challenges!

				<h3>Interests, Generally</h3>
				<p> Broadly, I'm interested in anything that requires me to tackle broad, challenging tasks with both quantatitve and qualitative strategies. I have an analytical mind and a technical background, and I'm excited by any opportunity where I can both be involved in scoping and design and to dig deep into numbers and code.</p>

				<h3>Vitae: Digital Hiring Halls for Online Workers</h3>
				<p>Workers are increasingly turning toward online freelancing—also known as "gig work"—as a replacement for the tradition 9-5 job. Gig work offers increased flexibility and unparalleled opportunities to gain additional experience and advance one's career. Unfortunately, it is also open to several key drawbacks.</p>
				<p>Namely, the online gig economy is <em>entirely unregulated and open to abuse </em>by requestors who post tedious but low-paying tasks for workers. And because workers often must start with accepting low-paying jobs to even get a foot in the door, such bad norms become self-perpetuating. Requestors take advantage of workers' willingness to accept low pay, creating a vicious cycle of poor-quality, low-paying tasks.</p>
				<p>We call this problem <em>a market for lemons</em>, based on the economics paper of the same name. As quality norms slip, requestors distrust workers and offer increasingly lower pay. In turn, workers feel less incentive to produce good output.</p>
				<p>Enter <em>Vitae</em>. The platform is inspired by historical hiring halls, which helped organize union workers. Our goal is to increase the complexity and payment level of tasks by organizing workers into qualification-based communities. The process of building such communities allows workers to set norms for work quality, marking certain tasks as "unacceptable." Whena a task violates a community's norms, workers can reject tasks—much in the same way that a union goes on strike—and thus cut off the labor supply until the requestor improves the task.</p>
				<p>In this way, we hope achieve a continuous virtuous cycle of setting high quality standards and improving treatment for workers.</p>
