	<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

	<p style=text-align:justify>		
		For as long as I can remember, I've been a writer.
		On my first birthday, as with many Chinese children, my family presented me with an array of novel objects. Money. A map. A book. And so on. It's said that what I chose would define the person I would become. </p>
	<p style=text-align:justify>
		<i>I chose a pen.</i>
	</p>

	<p style=text-align:justify>
		To this day, I see that choice as no accident. I quickly began "writing" stories---dictating wild imaginations to my parents and grandparents, then, eventually, committing them to paper on my own. Writing is, for me, much more than a means to an end---much more than the assignments and the accolades, much more than a mere vessel for words.
	</p>

	<p style=text-align:justify>
		Writing breathes life. And in this blog, whose code I'll also write (admittedly a very different kind of writing), I hope to convey a snapshot of my own life.
