            <p class="lead drop-cap">Four nights ago, thousands of miles away from my family, I cried alone in Cape Town, South Africa. It was the night before New Years' Eve.

            <p> I let my body shake away the pain and the bitterness and the happy facade I had presented throughout the day; I let myself fall silent in the calm that remained.

            <p> All of us define ourselves in some way. Perhaps you are the ‘band kid,’ in the running to be the next Stanford Tree; or maybe you are the ‘research guy,’ who got several grants to study molecular biology in Australia; or maybe you are ‘the a capella girl,’ who sings in the shower, sometimes unnecessarily at 1AM, and who sends such emails as “FWD: FWD: [PLEASE SHARE WIDELY] Spring show next Thursday!! Be there or be square!”

            <p> In other words, you are defined by the activity you spend time doing. The activity where you're meant to find success. For the past seven years of my life, I have been a debater. A high school side hobby became a social group, became a way of life. 

            <p> But that night I failed. I felt the world I had built crumbling, and I struggled to redefine myself. 

            <p> I recognized the feeling--in high school, I had competed for four years to qualify to a particular prestigious tournament known as the Tournament of Champions. I came close, but I never did. This was a fact that I hid from most people, an invisible chip on my shoulder. 

            <p> To the outside world, and to college applications especially, I played up my other achievements: I was top X at Y Tournament! I wrote my college essay about debate, describing how I defeated people who I once thought were unbeatable. The facts were true: I <em>did</em> place quite well at several tournaments. I had qualified to other championships. And I <em>did</em> defeat several particularly good debaters. But I knew only too well that top X was nowhere near the sort of achievements I had once dreamed of, and internally, I felt that I was an impostor. I felt that I had been rubbing shoulders with the good debaters, standing with them but not really among them, because here they had <i>won</i> the Harvard tournament, and I had blazed out in triple octafinals, ending my career and my dreams with them.

            <p> I vividly remember the night I flew out from Boston Logan Airport, leaving the Harvard tournament for the last time. I watched the lights glitter and grow dim as the airplane folded itself into the clouds, obscuring the city where I didn't quite reach success.

            <p> And so, when I stumbled into debate at Stanford, I was at first wary. I still reeled from high school disappointments, and I still harbored deep feelings of inadequacy; I hated being asked about whether I had been at the Tournament of Champions. I made up excuses--that weekend conflicted with Stanford Admit Weekend (true). But I strategically omitted the story about how I never qualified in the first place.

            <p> My reservations notwithstanding, I found myself being drawn back in. I discovered a sort of good-natured friendliness with college debaters; I became active in volunteering to improve the debate league. Still, it's nearly impossible to exist in a competitive activity without feeling the pressure of the competition itself. After all, debaters don’t spend their free time discussing how to materially improve the debate league. They spend their free time gossiping about the rankings--about who is particularly strong this year, about how well you’d need to do to break at Worlds (the college debate replacement for the Tournament of Champions). Debaters spend time talking about competition, not about service. 

            <p> Thus, after a relatively successful novice year, I began to feel the fire of competitiveness again. I imagined myself as a character in an action movie, in which they fail at first, and then, after a long training montage in which the character transforms into a superhero, they return victorious. I was Rocky; Hercules. Here was my chance to write my own comeback story.

            <p> It is obvious from the title that this is not the story I'm telling now. 

            <p> When I was eleven years old, my father told me that sometimes, dreams are like sand. If you hold a fistful of sand, the harder you squeeze, the more it slips away. I remember standing on a beach with my family, testing this theory. I buried my hands in sand, holding a fistful as tightly as I could. The tiny grains slipped through the cracks in my fingers, caught a gust of wind, and returned to the sea. I bent down again, squeezing harder; and again, holding on yet harder; each time the sand slipped away.

            <p> And so, the harder I clung onto debate, the more it seemed to elude my grasp. The more I dedicated myself to the idea of trying to win something, the more disappointments I began to experience: a failed bubble at the Yale IV. A failed bubble at NAUDC. Another failure at the Cambridge IV.

            <p> I tried everything. Cheering on teammates; focusing on fun experiences (like post-tournament food), complaining about bad luck, doubling down on practice. I made it a point to try local food and act like a tourist, sending pictures home to prove that I was, evidently, having capital-F Fun. I didn't need the wins; I'm just lucky to be here.

            <p> But I really couldn't fool myself. I couldn't undo the natural sense of competitiveness within me, which seemed to place me constantly on edge. I was acutely aware of the conversations dicussing the latest arguments and tournament results. I could spot the fellow competitor from the corner of my eye, watch him frantically parse the lastest BBC News. In every moment in which I wasn't studying for debate, I felt that I wasn't doing enough.

            <p> Training montage: work hard, bide your time, keep practicing. I imagined the debate equivalent of the weakling who hits the gym daily and becomes a superhero. 

            <p> Then came Worlds in Cape Town, South Africa. The tournament began on a good note, then slowly began slipping. I panicked; my scores had fallen into dangerous territory. I fought tooth and nail to keep my team in the running. But we had begun an accelerating losing trend, and I had no power to stop it. Eventually I came to realize that we were out of the tournament. This dream was over. 

            <p> Maybe I could have worked harder. I didn't manage to finish all the training videos, after all.

            <p> Maybe I could have put myself out there more, meeting all the judges and befriending everyone. Then they would remember my face, maybe feel more inclined to give me a vote.

            <p> Maybe I could have done more reading. I only have knowledge of a tiny fraction of the world.

            <p> In truth, when you're successful, you can attribute it to just about anything. I heard that a man who lived to age 100 once attributed his longevity to smoking cigars and a daily glass of strong whiskey. When you're unsuccessful, you can also blame it on just about anything. After all, the set of things you <i>didn't</i> do is infinite.

            <p> And so, lying alone that night in the silence of the Cape Town dorms, I drowned in a million what-ifs. What if I had worked harder? What if...?

            <p> I called my parents; I cried.

            <p> <em>Is a failed debater still a debater?</em>

            <p> I eventually came to two realizations.

            <p> First, I realized that debate does make me happy, despite the low moments. I thought of the night I left Harvard, ridden with shame and disappointment from my high school experience. I remembered my determination to stay away from debate in college--and then, eventually, caving back in because I loved the activity. I enjoy the public speaking and the research; the joy and energy that debate brings me is too deeply ingrained in my identity. I am, an always will be, a debater.

            <p> Second, I realized that, the more that debate becomes inextricable from competition, the more it poisons the benefits. I couldn't focus on friendship because I was distracted by conversations about the competition. I couldn't focus on the experience if I was too busy crying.

            <p> For so long, I had been fixated on turning myself into the perfect comeback story. But I am not so much the author of my own story as I am a grain of sand, slipping away from the grasping hands, hurtling towards the sea. Humans don't so much write their own stories as they simply tell them.

            <p> And let me be clear: I set out to achieve something, and I failed. Not once, but twice. 

            <p> The first time, I pretended that the failure never happened. I conveniently left out the failure when I re-told the story of how I defeated the other top debaters and came into myself. Success sells well; it is a feel-good tale of a come-from-behind win.

            <p> I could have done the same this time. Indeed, even in a largely failed Worlds run, I still managed to defeat teams that were incredibly successful. Indeed, I once defeated one of the four teams that made it to finals.

            <p> But the story I'll tell instead is of realistically embracing failure, as best as I can. I'm embracing the feelings of heartbreak and frustration, and I'm grateful that, among all things, I've failed in an ultimately arbitrary competitive activity. There are worse ways to fail, and few better ways to learn.

            <p> I learned that the reason why you stand back up after being knocked down is not because you ought to expect a better result. There is no guaranteed comeback story if you keep standing up. In fact, you ought to keep standing even if you know for certain that the result will be no better. Sometimes it will involve an alternative way of standing; sometimes it will involve walking to stand somewhere else. As part of the self-reflection process after the last week's events, for instance, I began this blog. I'm returning to my roots and writing again. 

            <p> I found that the critical thought process after failure has been profoundly healthy and beneficial. As I came to terms with the death of myself as some sort of future champion, I realized that I gained a great deal of humility. I spent more time listening than speaking. I spent more time watching the world, rolling down the windows as the Uber driver turned tight corners and snaked up mountain roads, allowing the South African wind to catch my hair and blow it into a wild, free tangle.

            <p> I also found just how much I appreciate the friends who did reach out--whether it was the ones who know very little about debate but who were willing to listen, or those who are deeply involved (my close friends; my debate partner) and who were willing to help comfort and encourage me in a low moment. These friends deserve much more than such a brief shout-out.

            <p> In short, I may still need to listen for a while longer. And I can't say for certain what has become of those dreams. The original title of this article was "Elegy to a Dream," but the story here is not so much one of death as it is one of metamorphosis.

            <p> Elegy. Metamorphosis. Or perhaps just a cry into the darkness, wondering what's to come.
