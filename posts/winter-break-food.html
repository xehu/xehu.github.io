            <p class="lead drop-cap">I am the sort of person who always orders things I've never tried before, purley for the experience. 

            <p>It's something of a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Usually, after consulting online reviews and asking for recommendations, I discover something novel and delicious. Occasionally there are the misses (I tried cereal-flavored ice cream once. It was terrible).

            <p>This Winter Break, I was on the road frequently--with my family to Cozumel and Progreso, Mexico, and with my school debate team to Cape Town, South Africa. Of course, international travel means a rare opportunity for the taste buds, and I relished the opportunity with gusto.

            <p>Here, I'll be highlighting my six favorite foods from the trip, and I'll also talk about them in 3 categories, on a scale of 1-10:

            <p>1. <b>Taste</b>. Obviously the most important thing, but merely a subjective judgement of how much I enjoyed the flavors of the dish.

            <p>2. <b>Presentation</b>. A-la Food Network (which I love to watch), it's critical that a food looks as good as it tastes. Plus, do it for the 'gram?

            <p>3. <b>Uniqueness.</b>. Does this food highlight local flavors? Is it a combination of things that I've never tried before? Does it give a fresh take on a classic menu item? In general, this is the category where I ask, 'why will I remember this meal, months after it's over?'

            <h2>6. Peach Soup from the Carnival Triumph</h2>
            <center>

            <p><b>Taste</b>: 8
            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 7
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 5

            <p>In general, the food on the Carnival Triumph (our cruise ship for the Mexico trip) was decent, but few of the meals were especially spectacular. They were, overall, standard, solid meals. My favorite from the trip, however, was the peach soup. The soup was served chilled, and the presentation was incredibly pleasant: the waiter poured it into the bowl in front of you with one quick swirl.

            <p>I loved its faint pink color, and its mild sweetness captured the taste of peaches well. I also found the idea of turning peaches into a chilled soup somewhat novel, since I had not previously tried a peach soup. Though I wouldn't book a cruise solely for the purpose of trying the peach soup, this is a recipe that I'd like to recreate on my own someday.


            <h2>5. Bobotie from the Rhodes Memorial Cafe</h2>
            <center>
                <img src="../images/food/bobotie.jpg" 
                         width=30%; height=30%; alt="">

            <p><b>Taste</b>: 8
            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 7
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 9

            <p>Bobotie is a classic South African dish, and I had the pleasure of trying it while I was visiting the country. The dish consists of meat (sort of a chili-like consistency) topped with a creamy custard-like covering, served in a bowl. It was meant to be eaten with a bowl of rice, served on the side. This particular bobotie was ostrich meat, which I found tasted quite similar to beef.

            <p>I loved the color scheme of this dish. The yellow contrasted so beautifully with the golden brown of the meat, and the taste balanced umami with delicious spices. It also helped that we were seated outdoors, high up enough in the mountains that I could view the sea. Taking an afternoon to hike up to the cafe and try out the bobotie definitely made the day worthwhile.


            <h2>4. Hazelnut Latte from Cocoa Wah-Wah</h2>

            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 9
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 4

            <p>One of my debate teammates discovered a lovely little cafe about five minutes from the dormitories where we were staying. Cocoa served delciious drinks--the hazlenut latte came with beautiful marbled layers, and its sweetness was perfect and not too overpowering. As soon as I had ordered it, someone else came and asked me for the name of the drink so that they could order it themselves--only validating the latte's place on this list.

            <h2>3. Game Meat Platter</h2>
            <center>
                <img src="../images/food/game-meat.jpg"

            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 7
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 9

            <p>On New Year's Eve, a few friends and I randomly chose a restaurant on the streets of Cape Town. I asked the waiter for a recommendation, and he showed me the Game Meat Platter--a combination of several 'game meats' (i.e., animals one would find on a safari), served in a sort of tasting plate.

            <p>I don't recall all the game meats present, but the platter includes emu, alligator, and several others. All were cooked perfectly, and the ribs in particular were delicious. Many of the red meats tasted generally very similar to a tender beef steak; the alligator was the only point of contention among those who ordered the platter. Some argued that it tasted like chicken; I felt that it tasted more similar to a melt-in-your-mouth sort of fish (perhaps a mahi-mahi?), but that it did have the chewy texture of chicken. Regardless, we all felt that the platter was delectable.

            <p><b>Taste</b>: 10
            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 5
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 7

            <p> We arrived at New Orleans, our port of call for the cruise, one day early, and my family and I had the opportunity to try out the famous French-style cafe, The cafe had an incredibly simple menu--if I recall correctly, it offered only two coffee options in addition to the famous beignets, but it's clear that it has specialized incredbily well. Though the beignets exploded my clothing with powdered sugar, they were divine, and, combined with the slightly bitter taste of coffee, made for an incredible breakfast.

            <h2>1. Five-Course Tasting Menu from Janse & Co.</h2>
                        <center>
                <img src="../images/food/five-course-meal.jpg"

            <p><b>Presentation</b>: 10
            <p><b>Uniqueness</b>: 8

            <p> The morning I left South Africa, a few teammates and I had the opportunity to land a reservation at Janse, a high-end restaurant that serves food from a multi-course tasting menu. The minimum number of courses one chose from the menu was two; the maximum, five.

            <p> Since the price of the five-course meal was only about $36 USD, I chose the five--'go big or go home,' as they say. The experience was entirely worthwhile.

            <p> Our waiter personally presented each course to us, explaining the creative process behind the dishes and describing each incredient with precise detail. Each course was served with a substantial amount of time in between, and the portion sizes were relatively small, so I never felt particularly stuffed. Indeed, the courses were packed with flavor. Some of the flavors were surprisingly delicious. For example, I never expected how tasty the salty crunch of seaweed would be in combination with five types of tomato. My favorite of the courses was the raw tuna, which was seasoned perfectly and paired well with cooked bell pepper. Dessert was
